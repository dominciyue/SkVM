# Vera Language Reference

Vera is a programming language designed for LLMs to write. It uses typed slot references instead of variable names, requires contracts on every function, and makes all effects explicit.

## Installation

Vera requires Python 3.11 or later. Node.js 22+ is optional (only needed for `vera compile --target browser` and browser parity tests).

**Recommended — install from the GitHub source checkout.** The checkout is the full environment this file teaches from: alongside the compiler and the `vera` CLI it carries the bundled `examples/`, the conformance suite in `tests/conformance/` (minimal working programs for every language feature), and the specification in `spec/`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aallan/vera.git && cd vera
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -e .
```

For an editable source install with the language server, use `python -m pip install -e ".[lsp]"` — see [LSP_SERVER.md](LSP_SERVER.md). Verify the install end to end with the bundled example:

```bash
vera check examples/hello_world.vera    # should print "OK: examples/hello_world.vera"
vera run examples/hello_world.vera      # should print "Hello, World!"
```

**Toolchain only — install the released `veralang` distribution from PyPI.** This installs the `vera` command and all runtime dependencies (Lark parser, Z3 solver, wasmtime), but **not** the examples, conformance programs, or specification — those exist only in the checkout:

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install veralang
vera version
```

For the language server on this route, install `python -m pip install "veralang[lsp]"`.

If you are working on the compiler itself, install development dependencies too:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

> **Platform support**: Vera is tested in CI on macOS 15+ (Apple Silicon), Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (x86_64), and Windows Server 2022, against Python 3.11–3.13. macOS 14 (Sonoma) and earlier, and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS aarch64, are out of scope — install will fail at dependency resolution. See [README §Supported platforms](README.md#supported-platforms) for the full matrix, workarounds, and the data behind the baseline.
>
> **For agents running in a sandbox** (Claude.ai, Code Interpreter, container-based execution environments, etc.): the steps above work. Sandboxes typically have Python, `git`, `pip`, and outbound network access — that's all Vera needs. **Run the install commands and verify with `vera run examples/hello_world.vera` before concluding that Vera "isn't available." Don't assume the sandbox lacks the toolchain — try it.**
>
> One caveat: `pip install vera` installs a *different* package from PyPI (an ERAV citizen-science library — unrelated to this Vera). Use the `veralang` distribution or the GitHub source clone shown above; both install the `vera` command.

## Toolchain

See [TOOLCHAIN.md](TOOLCHAIN.md) for the CLI cookbook — driving the toolchain to write, verify, test, run, and debug Vera, plus the `builtins`/`effects`/`errors` introspection commands.

```

Errors are natural language instructions explaining what went wrong and how to fix it. Feed them back into your context to correct the code.

`vera test` generates Z3 inputs for `Int`, `Nat`, `Bool`, `Byte`, `String`, and `Float64` parameters. The decision is made on each parameter's **resolved** type, not its spelling: a type alias or refinement that resolves to one of those six is generated for like any other, so a parameter spelled `@Count` under `type Count = Nat;` is not skipped for its parameter type, and an alias-spelled `requires` still constrains the inputs. (Trials are what a *Tier 3* contract gets; a signature the verifier proves reports `VERIFIED (Tier 1)` instead, and one with only trivial contracts is skipped as `trivial contracts only`.) A parameter resolving to an ADT or a function type is skipped with a message naming that resolved type — `type MaybeCount = Option<Nat>` skips with `cannot generate Option<Nat> inputs`. A generic function is skipped as `generic function` before its parameter types are considered at all, so a `forall<T>` signature never reports a per-parameter reason even when every parameter is generable. A generable signature is also skipped when a `requires` conjunct — or a refined parameter's predicate — is outside the SMT layer's decidable fragment, since Z3 could not constrain the generated inputs by it; the skip names the conjunct (`cannot generate inputs satisfying `` `string_length(@String.0) > 0` ``), because running trials the precondition never shaped would report the function's own entry-guard trap as a broken contract. `string_length` over a non-literal is the usual trigger — Vera counts UTF-8 bytes and Z3's string theory has no byte-length operator — so compare a `string_length` against a literal where you want the function trialled. Float64 uses Z3's mathematical reals (NaN, ±∞, and subnormals are not generated). Strings are capped at 50 characters.

### Browser compilation

`vera compile --target browser` produces a ready-to-serve browser bundle:

```bash
vera compile --target browser file.vera            # Output to file_browser/
vera compile --target browser file.vera -o dist/   # Output to dist/
```

This generates three files: `module.wasm` (the compiled binary), `vera-runtime.mjs` (self-contained JavaScript runtime with all host bindings), and `index.html` (loads and runs the program). Serve the output directory with any HTTP server (`python -m http.server`) and open `index.html` — ES module imports require HTTP, not `file://`.

The JavaScript runtime provides browser-appropriate implementations: `IO.print` writes to the page, `IO.read_line` uses `prompt()`, `IO.stderr` captures into a separate buffer, `IO.time` uses `Date.now()`, `IO.sleep` busy-waits (main-thread blocking — best kept short in the browser), file IO returns `Result.Err`, and `IO.read_char` returns `Result.Err` pending JSPI suspend/resume support ([#609](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/609) / [#618](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/618)). All other operations (State, contracts, Markdown) work identically to the Python runtime.

#### IO model: terminal vs browser

Vera's "write once, run anywhere" claim has a real seam at the IO boundary, and writing for one target without thinking about the other will produce a program that compiles cleanly to both but only *runs* meaningfully on one:

- **Terminal target** assumes a synchronous IO loop: `IO.sleep(120)` blocks the program for 120 ms (fine), ANSI escape codes (`"\u{1B}[2J\u{1B}[H"` to clear screen + home cursor) drive cursor and colour, and the program drives its own pacing.
- **Browser target** assumes "Vera = pure simulation core, JS = timing and rendering driver".  `IO.sleep` still works numerically but busy-waits on the main thread (freezing the tab); ANSI escape codes render as literal control bytes in the DOM rather than mutating a virtual screen; `IO.print` writes to the page (good) but the program has no way to *yield* between writes.

The recommended pattern for browser-targeted Vera programs is to **expose pure update functions** (`@State<T>, @Input -> @State<T>`) that JavaScript drives via `requestAnimationFrame`, with Vera computing the next state and JS handling timing + DOM updates.  Pulling on this thread, two runtime gaps make the recommended pattern less ergonomic than it should be — both are tracked and neither is closed today:

- [#609](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/609) — implement `IO.sleep` against the WebAssembly JavaScript Promise Integration (JSPI) proposal so the WASM call suspends on `setTimeout` instead of busy-waiting.
- [#610](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/610) — interpret a minimal ANSI escape subset in the browser runtime so terminal-style programs (clear-screen, cursor-home, colour) render unchanged.

Until those land, terminal Vera programs (animation via `IO.sleep` + cursor control via ANSI) need either a terminal target or a deliberate browser-shaped variant.  The design point ("pure core, effects at the boundary") is unchanged; the boundary just differs between targets.

### WASI Preview 2 compilation (experimental)

`vera compile --target wasi-p2` emits a binary WebAssembly *component* that runs under any stock wasip2 host with no Vera bindings — `wasmtime run file.wasm` just works.  The target covers the **IO and Random host families only**; a program using any other family (Http, Map, Set, Decimal, Json, Html, Md, Regex, Math, Inference, State, Async, DB) is rejected with a diagnostic naming the family.  `vera run --target wasi-p2 file.vera` executes the component under the built-in wasip2 host with the usual output/trap reporting.  Divergences inherent to WASI 0.2 (exit codes collapse to 0/1; no structured trap frames) are documented in [spec chapter 13](spec/13-wasi.md).  `--world server` packages a `handle(Request -> Response)` program (the `<HttpServer>` effect) as a `wasi:http/incoming-handler` component that stock `wasmtime serve` runs — headers work via in-guest String maps; stdin/filesystem/env ops are rejected in that world (spec §13.7).

To run the WASM directly in Node.js:

```bash
node --experimental-wasm-exnref vera/browser/harness.mjs module.wasm
```

### JSON diagnostics

Use `--json` on `check` or `verify` for machine-readable output:

```json
{"ok": true, "file": "...", "diagnostics": [], "warnings": []}
```

On error, each diagnostic includes `severity`, `description`, `location` (`file`, `line`, `column`), `source_line`, `rationale`, `fix`, `spec_ref`, and `error_code`. The `verify --json` output also includes a `verification` summary with `tier1_verified`, `tier3_runtime`, and `total` counts.

### Error codes

Every diagnostic has a stable code grouped by compiler phase — the `W` series is warnings, the `E` series errors:

- **W001** — Typed hole (`?`) — expected type and available bindings reported (warning, not error)
- **W002** — `async()` argument evaluates eagerly: its effects fall outside the commutative set (`Http`), so the future is computed sequentially at the `async()` site rather than concurrently (warning, not error)
- **E001–E007** — Parse errors (missing contracts, unexpected tokens)
- **E020, E021, E023** — Malformed comments: unterminated `{-` (E020) or `/*` (E021), or a `/*` nested inside another (E023 — only `{- -}` nests). Each names the delimiter at fault and how to close it.
- **E010** — Transform errors (internal)
- **E120–E176** — Type check: core + expressions (type mismatches, slot resolution, operators)
- **E200–E233** — Type check: calls (unresolved functions, argument mismatches, module calls)
- **E300–E335** — Type check: control flow (if/match, patterns, effect handlers)
- **E500–E528** — Verification (contract violations, undecidable fallbacks, primitive-operation safety incl. arithmetic overflow)
- **E600–E614** — Codegen (unsupported features, typed holes block compilation)
- **E700–E702** — Testing (contract violations, input generation, execution errors)

In diagnostic messages, a `?` inside a printed type (`Array<?>`, `Map<String, ?>`) marks a component the checker could not infer. That is a rendering marker for an unknown type, not the typed-hole expression `?` (W001) you write in source.

Common codes you'll encounter:
- **W001** — Typed hole: fill `?` with an expression of the stated type
- **E130** — Unresolved slot reference (`@T.n` has no matching binding)
- **E121** — Function body type doesn't match return type
- **E200** — Unresolved function call
- **E300** — If condition is not Bool
- **E001** — Missing contract block (requires/ensures/effects)
- **E614** — Program contains typed holes; compile rejected until holes are filled

## Function Structure

Every function has this exact structure. No part is optional except `decreases` and `where`. Visibility (`public` or `private`) is mandatory on every top-level `fn` and `data` declaration.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="MISMATCH" reason="Function signature template with @ParamType placeholders" -->
```vera
private fn function_name(@ParamType1, @ParamType2 -> @ReturnType)
  requires(precondition_expression)
  ensures(postcondition_expression)
  effects(effect_row)
{
  body_expression
}
```

Complete example:

```vera
public fn safe_divide(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(@Int.1 != 0)
  ensures(@Int.result == @Int.0 / @Int.1)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 / @Int.1
}
```

### Nullary and Unit-taking functions

Vera accepts two equivalent shapes for functions that take no meaningful argument:

```vera
public fn a(-> @Int)        requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure) { 42 }
public fn b(@Unit -> @Int)  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure) { 42 }
```

At every call site the arity must match the declaration: `a()` calls the nullary form, `b(())` passes a `Unit` value to the Unit-taking form. They cannot be mixed — `a(())` and `b()` are both type errors. Use the nullary form for constants and computations that have no conceptual input; use the Unit-taking form when you want to match the shape of a combinator that expects a `Fn(T -> U)` (the callee side of `apply_fn`, see below) or when the program's entry point traditionally takes `Unit`. `main` works either way; all examples in this file use `main(@Unit -> @Unit)` for consistency with the broader spec.

### Stored function values and `apply_fn`

Functions passed as arguments or stored in `let` bindings use the type form `Fn(T -> U) effects(...)`. To invoke such a stored value, use `apply_fn`:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Type alias (Fn type) in apply_fn docs, bare declaration" -->
```vera
type IntToInt = Fn(Int -> Int) effects(pure)

private fn use_fn(@IntToInt, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure)
{
  apply_fn(@IntToInt.0, @Int.0)
}
```

`apply_fn(f, x)` is the only way to call a function that's stored as a value — direct application syntax (`f(x)`) is reserved for declared names. The prelude uses this pattern for `option_map`, `option_and_then`, `result_map` etc., where the mapping function is a parameter. See `examples/closures.vera` and `tests/conformance/ch05_closures.vera` for worked examples.

## Function Visibility

Every top-level `fn` and `data` declaration **must** have an explicit visibility modifier. There is no default visibility -- omitting it is an error.

- `public` -- the declaration is visible to other modules that import this one. Only `public` functions are exported as WASM entry points (callable via `vera run`). Use for library APIs, exported functions, and program entry points.
- `private` -- the declaration is only visible within the current file/module. Private functions compile but are not WASM exports. Use for internal helpers.

```vera
public fn exported_api(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0
}

private fn internal_helper(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 + 1
}

public data Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue
}

private data InternalState {
  Ready,
  Done(Int)
}
```

For generic functions, visibility comes before `forall`:

```vera
private forall<T> fn identity(@T -> @T)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @T.0
}
```

Visibility does **not** apply to: type aliases (`type Foo = ...`), effect declarations (`effect E { ... }`), module declarations, or import statements. Functions inside `where` blocks also do not take visibility.

Multiple `requires` and `ensures` clauses are allowed. They are conjunctive (AND'd together):

```vera
private fn clamp_to_range(@Int, @Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(@Int.1 <= @Int.0)
  ensures(@Int.result >= @Int.1)
  ensures(@Int.result <= @Int.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Int.2 < @Int.1 then {
    @Int.1
  } else {
    if @Int.2 > @Int.0 then {
      @Int.0
    } else {
      @Int.2
    }
  }
}
```

## Slot References (`@T.n`)

**De Bruijn slot ordering is the most common source of bugs in Vera programs.** Before writing contracts, `ensures` clauses, or body expressions that involve multiple parameters of the same type, run `vera check --explain-slots` to confirm which index maps to which parameter. Do not rely on intuition.

Vera has no variable names. Every binding is referenced by type and index. See [`DE_BRUIJN.md`](DE_BRUIJN.md) for the academic background, deeper examples, and the commutative-operations trap.

```
@Type.index
```

- `@` is the slot reference prefix (mandatory)
- `Type` is the exact type of the binding, starting with uppercase
- `.index` is the zero-based De Bruijn index (0 = most recent binding of that type)

### Parameter ordering

Parameters bind left-to-right. The **rightmost** parameter of a given type is `@T.0`:

```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Int.result == @Int.0 + @Int.1)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 + @Int.1
}
-- @Int.0 = second parameter (rightmost Int)
-- @Int.1 = first parameter (leftmost Int)
```

### Mixed types

Each type has its own index counter:

```vera
private fn repeat(@String, @Int -> @String)
  requires(@Int.0 >= 0)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  string_repeat(@String.0, @Int.0)
}
-- @String.0 = first parameter (only String)
-- @Int.0 = second parameter (only Int)
```

### Let bindings push new slots

```vera
private fn example(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  let @Int = @Int.0 * 2;     -- @Int.0 here refers to the parameter
  let @Int = @Int.0 + 1;     -- @Int.0 here refers to the first let (param * 2)
  @Int.0                      -- refers to the second let (param * 2 + 1)
}
```

### `@T.result`

Only valid inside `ensures` clauses. Refers to the function's return value:

```vera
private fn absolute(@Int -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Nat.result >= 0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Int.0 >= 0 then {
    @Int.0
  } else {
    -@Int.0
  }
}
```

### Index is mandatory

`@Int` alone is not a valid reference. Always write `@Int.0`, `@Int.1`, etc.

### Debugging slot indices with --explain-slots

**Always run `vera check --explain-slots` before writing contracts or function calls that
involve multiple parameters of the same type.** This is the single most reliable way to avoid
De Bruijn ordering mistakes.

```bash
vera check --explain-slots your_file.vera
```

Output:

```text
Slot environments (index 0 = last occurrence in signature):

  fn divide(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
    @Int.0  parameter 2 (last @Int)
    @Int.1  parameter 1 (first @Int)
```

`where`-block helpers get their own table, indented under their parent:

```text
  fn is_even(@Nat -> @Bool)
    @Nat.0  parameter 1 (only @Nat)
    where fn is_odd(@Nat -> @Bool)
      @Nat.0  parameter 1 (only @Nat)
```

**Read this table before writing any contract or recursive call.** The ordering only matters
when a function has multiple parameters of the same type — but that is exactly when bugs occur.

Example: for `fn divide(@Int, @Int -> @Int)`, the contract `requires(@Int.1 != 0)` guards the
*first* parameter (the divisor). Confirm this by checking the table: `@Int.1 = parameter 1
(first @Int)`.

**Workflow:**
1. Write the function signature.
2. Run `vera check --explain-slots` to get the slot table.
3. Use the table to write contracts and body expressions with correct `@T.n` indices.
4. If `vera check` reports E130 (unresolved slot), read the `Available bindings:` table in its
   own fix text — it lists the slot bindings in scope *at that reference* with their `@T.n`,
   including the `let` and `match`-arm ones the signature table cannot show. The table renders
   at most twelve rows and then `; … and K more`, so a scope wider than that shows its first
   twelve bindings and names how many it withheld. `@T.result` is not a slot binding, so it
   never appears there, not even inside `ensures`.

The `--json` flag also works: `vera check --explain-slots --json` emits a `slot_environments`
array, useful when processing diagnostics programmatically.

## Types

### Primitive types

- `Bool` — `true`, `false`
- `Int` — signed integers (arbitrary precision)
- `Nat` — natural numbers (non-negative)
- `Float64` — 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point
- `Byte` — unsigned 8-bit integer (0–255)
- `String` — text
- `Unit` — singleton type, value is `()`. Zero-size and **declaration-only**: a `@Unit` parameter (function or handler-clause op) is legal but reading it (`@Unit.0`) is a checker error (E182) — write the literal `()` instead — and a `let` of a zero-size type (`let @Unit = put(5);`) is a checker error (E183) — call the expression as a statement (`put(5);`). Applies to anything with no runtime representation, including `Future<Unit>`.
- `Never` — bottom type (used for non-terminating expressions like `throw`)

**`Int` and `Nat` are interchangeable in both directions.**  `@Nat <: @Int` is a formal subtyping rule at the *type* level (use a `@Nat` anywhere `@Int` is expected, no `nat_to_int` call), and `@Int <: @Nat` is permitted by the type checker with a verifier-discharged obligation (`@Int.0 >= 0`).  This means `array_length` (declared `@Int`) flows freely into `@Nat` positions without explicit conversion — the verifier proves non-negativity from context or falls back to a runtime check.  Both directions carry a *value*-level obligation, because `@Nat` is a u64 and `@Int` an i64: narrowing requires `>= 0` (`E503`/`E504`), and widening requires `<= i64.MAX` (`E530`; or an `E531` warning at the generic-instantiated `@Int`-field component site code generation cannot guard) — a `@Nat` above i64.MAX bit-reinterprets to a negative `@Int`.  Runtime guards and verifier obligations correspond at every closure depth (nested closure returns included); the documented residual runs in one direction only.  Obligated-but-not-guarded: three narrowing sites are statically obligated yet carry no runtime guard — a user-declared effect operation's argument and the generic-instantiated constructor field ([#754](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/754)/[#757](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/757)), and the `nat_to_int`/`nat_to_string` conversion builtins — where an `E504` warning discloses the unguarded residual rather than claiming a check the runtime never performs.  The built-in effects' operation arguments are guarded: the `State` write boundaries, and the `Exn` `throw` payload, which also takes the refinement-predicate guard ([#1268](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/1268)).  **Do not** insert `nat_to_int` defensively; `@Nat` already flows to `@Int`. Keep a value that may be negative as `@Int`, or use `int_to_nat` (which returns `Option`) when an explicit narrowing must handle the failure case.  See spec §2.2.1 for the formal rule.

### Composite types

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Composite type examples, bare type expressions" -->
```vera
@Array<Int>                              -- array of ints
@Array<Option<Int>>                      -- array of ADT (compound element type)
@Array<String>                           -- array of strings
@Tuple<Int, String>                      -- tuple
@Option<Int>                             -- Option type (Some/None)
@Map<String, Int>                        -- key-value map (keys: Eq + Hash)
@Set<Int>                                -- unordered unique elements (Eq + Hash)
@Decimal                                 -- exact decimal arithmetic
@Json                                    -- JSON data (parse/query/serialize)
@HtmlNode                                -- HTML document node (parse/query/serialize)
Fn(Int -> Int) effects(pure)              -- function type
{ @Int | @Int.0 > 0 }                   -- refinement type
```

### Array literals

Write `[1, 2, 3]` for a populated array and `[]` for an empty one. The element type is inferred from the elements when present, and from the surrounding type annotation when the literal is empty:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Array literal examples, bare let bindings (#513)" -->
```vera
let @Array<Int> = [1, 2, 3];              -- populated: elements determine type
let @Array<Bool> = [true, false];          -- populated, any element type
let @Array<Int> = [];                      -- empty: annotation determines type
let @Array<Array<Int>> = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]; -- nested arrays
let @Array<Json> = [JNumber(1.0), JNull];   -- ADT elements
```

Empty arrays **must** appear in a position with a known type — a `let` binding with a type annotation, a function argument whose parameter type is known, or the branch of a match arm whose type is fixed by another arm. An empty literal with no surrounding type context is a type error. When the element type is polymorphic in the context (e.g. returning `Array<T>` from a `forall<T>` function body), annotate the `let` or thread through a concrete instantiation.

`[` and `]` are context-disambiguated: in expression position (`let @Array<Int> = []`) they delimit an array literal; in postfix position (`@Array<Int>.0[@Int.0]`) they are the index operator — see the operator precedence table at the bottom of this file. The parser resolves the two by lookahead; there is no ambiguity you need to work around.

### Tuples

Tuples are constructed with the `Tuple(...)` constructor and destructured with the same shape inside `match`:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Tuple construction + destructuring example, bare let + match" -->
```vera
let @Tuple<Int, String> = Tuple(42, "hello");
match @Tuple<Int, String>.0 {
  Tuple(@Int, @String) -> @Int.0   -- => 42
}
```

`Tuple` is just an upper-case constructor — there is no special tuple-literal syntax (no `(1, 2, 3)` form). The empty tuple `Tuple<>` is equivalent to `Unit`.

### Type aliases

```vera
type PosInt = { @Int | @Int.0 > 0 };
type Name = String;
```

An alias is **opaque as the head** of a slot name and **transparent inside type arguments**
(spec §3.8.1). A parameter written `@PosInt` is referenced `@PosInt.0`, never `@Int.0` — the
two are separate namespaces. A parameter written `@Option<Name>` binds `Option<String>`, so it
is referenced `@Option<String>.0`. When in doubt, run `vera check --explain-slots`: it prints
the resolved name of every parameter.

## Data Types (ADTs)

```vera
private data Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue
}

private data List<T> {
  Nil,
  Cons(T, List<T>)
}

private data Option<T> {
  None,
  Some(T)
}
```

> **Note:** `Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>`, `Ordering`, and `UrlParts` are provided by the standard prelude and available in every program without explicit `data` declarations. You only need to define them locally if you want to shadow the prelude definition.

With an invariant *(NYI — see [#686](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/686); use a refinement type instead, shown below)*:

```vera
private data Positive invariant(@Int.0 > 0) {
  MkPositive(Int)
}
```

The `invariant(...)` clause on `data` declarations is specified but not currently working in the reference compiler — every documented form fails with `[E130] no <DataName> bindings in scope`.  Until that's fixed, express the same constraint with a refinement type:

```vera
type Positive = { @Int | @Int.0 > 0 };
```

## Pattern Matching

```vera
private fn to_int(@Color -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  match @Color.0 {
    Red -> 0,
    Green -> 1,
    Blue -> 2
  }
}
```

Patterns can bind values:

```vera
private fn unwrap_or(@Option<Int>, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  match @Option<Int>.0 {
    None -> @Int.0,
    Some(@Int) -> @Int.0
  }
}
```

Available patterns: constructors (`Some(@Int)`), nullary constructors (`None`, `Red`), literals (`0`, `"x"`, `true`), wildcard (`_`).

Match must be exhaustive.

## Conditional Expressions

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="If/else expression example" -->
```vera
if @Bool.0 then {
  expr1
} else {
  expr2
}
```

Both branches are mandatory. Braces are mandatory. Each branch is always multi-line (closing brace on its own line).

## Block Expressions

Blocks contain statements followed by a final expression:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Block expression example" -->
```vera
{
  let @Int = @Int.0 + 1;
  let @String = to_string(@Int.0);
  IO.print(@String.0);
  @Int.0
}
```

Statements end with `;`. The final expression (no `;`) is the block's value.

## Typed Holes

**When you do not know the right expression to write, use `?` rather than guessing.** A typed hole tells you immediately what type is needed and what bindings are available — it is always faster than writing the wrong thing and debugging the type error.

```vera
public fn double(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure)
{
  ?
}
```

`vera check` reports a `W001` warning (not an error):

```text
Warning [W001]: Typed hole: expected Int.
Fix: Replace ? with an expression of type Int. Available bindings: @Int.0: Int.
```

The program type-checks successfully (`ok: true`) — holes are warnings, not errors. This means you can check the *rest* of a function for type errors while one expression is still incomplete.

`vera check --json` includes hole warnings in the `warnings` array with the full expected type and binding context, making them machine-readable for agent workflows.

**Programs with holes cannot be compiled.** `vera compile` and `vera run` reject any program containing `?` with an `E614` error.

### Workflow

Use holes to build programs incrementally:

```vera
public fn safe_div(@Int, @Int -> @Option<Int>)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure)
{
  if ? then {       -- W001: expected Bool. Bindings: @Int.0: Int; @Int.1: Int
    Some(?)         -- W001: expected Int.  Bindings: @Int.0: Int; @Int.1: Int
  } else {
    None
  }
}
```

Check this, read the `W001` fix hints, then fill in the holes:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Typed hole fill-in example, bare if/else expression" -->
```vera
  if @Int.0 != 0 then {
    Some(@Int.1 / @Int.0)
  } else {
    None
  }
```

### Multiple holes

Multiple holes in one program each produce their own `W001` warning with independent context. You can fill them one at a time and re-check between iterations.

### Conformance

See `tests/conformance/ch03_typed_holes.vera` for a minimal working example.

## Iteration

Vera has no `for` or `while` loops. Iteration is always expressed as tail-recursive functions. The standard pattern for counted iteration:

```vera
private fn loop(@Nat, @Nat -> @Unit)
  requires(@Nat.0 <= @Nat.1)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO>)
{
  IO.print(string_concat(fizzbuzz(@Nat.0), "\n"));
  if @Nat.0 < @Nat.1 then {
    loop(@Nat.1, @Nat.0 + 1)
  } else {
    ()
  }
}
```

Here `@Nat.0` is the counter (De Bruijn index 0 = most recent, i.e. the second parameter) and `@Nat.1` is the limit (the first parameter). The contract `requires(@Nat.0 <= @Nat.1)` ensures the counter never exceeds the limit — and since the recursive call passes `@Nat.0 + 1` where `@Nat.0 < @Nat.1`, the precondition is maintained at every step. The function prints, then either recurses with an incremented counter or returns `()`.

Call with the limit first and counter second: `loop(100, 1)`.

For pure recursive functions that need termination proofs, add a `decreases` clause (see [Recursion](#recursion)). Effectful recursive functions like the loop above do not require `decreases`.

## Closures and captured bindings

Anonymous functions are written `fn(@ParamType1, @ParamType2 -> @ReturnType) effects(effect_row) { body_expression }`. They are first-class values and can be passed to higher-order built-ins (`array_map`, `array_filter`, `array_fold`, `array_any`, `array_find`, `array_sort_by`, …) or stored in `let` bindings.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Closure example, bare let bindings with array_map (#513)" -->
```vera
let @Array<Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let @Array<Int> = array_map(
  @Array<Int>.0,
  fn(@Int -> @Int) effects(pure) { @Int.0 * 2 }
);
-- Result: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Inside the closure body, `@Int.0` is the closure's own parameter (index 0 = most recent binding). This matches how slot indices work in top-level `fn` declarations.

### Capturing outer bindings

**Closures can capture any outer binding** — primitives (`Int`, `Nat`, `Bool`, `Byte`, `Float64`), pair types (`String`, `Array<T>`), single-pointer ADTs (`Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>`, user-defined `data` types), and the opaque-handle ADTs (`Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`, `Decimal`).

Outer bindings are available at higher De Bruijn indices — the closure's own parameters are pushed on top of the slot stack, so outer `@T` bindings shift up by the number of inner `@T` parameters.

```vera
-- WORKS: capturing a primitive @Int.
public fn sum_plus_offset(@Unit -> @Int)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure)
{
  let @Int = 100;                      -- outer binding: @Int.0 = 100
  let @Array<Int> = [1, 2, 3];
  array_fold(
    @Array<Int>.0,
    0,
    -- array_fold's closure shape is fn(@Acc, @Elem -> @Acc) — accumulator
    -- first.  By the rightmost = .0 rule, that puts the element at .0
    -- and the accumulator at .1 inside the body.
    fn(@Int, @Int -> @Int) effects(pure) {
      -- Inside this closure body, two @Int params are in scope:
      --   @Int.0 = element (most recent, the iterator's current value)
      --   @Int.1 = accumulator
      --   @Int.2 = outer `let @Int = 100`  (captured — primitive, OK)
      @Int.1 + @Int.0 + @Int.2
    }
  )
}
-- 0+1+100 + 2+100 + 3+100 = 306
```

The rule when capture IS safe: count the closure's own `@T` parameters, and the outermost captured `@T` binding sits at that index. A closure with no `@Int` parameters of its own would see the outer `let @Int` as `@Int.0`; a closure with two `@Int` parameters sees it as `@Int.2`. Types are independent — a closure's `@Int` parameter does not shift outer `@String` bindings.

Use `vera check --explain-slots file.vera` if you need the resolved index table printed for a specific function (including closures).

### Capturing a pair-typed value

Capturing a `String` or `Array<T>` works the same way as capturing any other outer binding — the closure-struct layout serialises both halves of the (ptr, len) pair, so `array_length` / `string_length` / element-access all see the captured value correctly inside the closure body.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Pair-type capture example (post-#535), bare let-in-closure" -->
```vera
-- Capture an outer Array<Int> and read its length inside the closure.
let @Array<Int> = [10, 20, 30];        -- captured (outer) @Array<Int>.0 = this
let @Array<Int> = [1, 2, 3];           -- iterated (inner) @Array<Int>.0 = this
                                       --             outer shifts to .1
array_fold(
  @Array<Int>.0,
  0,
  fn(@Int, @Int -> @Int) effects(pure) {
    -- Inside the closure: @Int.0 = element, @Int.1 = acc.
    -- @Array<Int>.1 refers to the OUTER (captured) array.
    @Int.1 + @Int.0 + nat_to_int(array_length(@Array<Int>.1))
  }
)
-- 0+1+3 + 2+3 + 3+3 = 15
```

The same applies to `String` captures.  ADT captures (`Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>`, user `data` types, `Json`, `HtmlNode`, `MdBlock`, opaque handles `Map<K, V>` / `Set<T>` / `Decimal`) work too — they're single-i32 wrapper pointers that the closure-struct layout handles directly.

### When to use recursion instead

Closures cover pure, self-contained transformations and simple captured constants. Prefer a top-level recursive function when any of these hold:

- The body needs an effect row other than `pure` that doesn't match the combinator's expected effect signature.
- The body needs to early-return or short-circuit in a way the combinator doesn't provide (`array_find` / `array_any` / `array_all` short-circuit; `array_map` / `array_fold` do not).
- The iteration shape isn't one-pass left-to-right (e.g. you need to look ahead, or process in reverse while mutating a different data structure).
- Termination requires a `decreases` clause that proves non-trivial progress — closures cannot carry `decreases`.

For counted iteration with IO, use the recursive `loop` pattern from the Iteration section above; for array transformations, use the array combinators with closures.

### Nested closures

Closures inside closure bodies work end-to-end — the natural 2D `array_map(rows, fn(row) { array_map(cols, fn(col) { ... }) })` shape compiles, validates, and runs at any return type. Captures from the outer scope flow through nested closures correctly for every type that can be captured at the top level (primitives, pair types, ADTs, opaque handles). Three or more levels of nesting work the same way; the lifting pass uses a worklist that handles arbitrary depth.

```vera
public fn build_grid(@Unit -> @Array<Array<Int>>)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(pure)
{
  -- 2D array of products via nested array_map.
  array_map(
    array_range(0, 3),
    fn(@Int -> @Array<Int>) effects(pure) {
      array_map(
        array_range(0, 3),
        fn(@Int -> @Int) effects(pure) { @Int.0 + @Int.1 }
      )
    }
  )
}
```

## Built-in Functions

### Naming convention

All built-in functions follow predictable naming patterns. When guessing a function name you haven't seen, apply these rules:

| Pattern | When | Examples |
|---------|------|----------|
| `domain_verb` | Most functions | `string_length`, `array_append`, `regex_match`, `md_parse` |
| `source_to_target` | Type conversions | `int_to_float`, `float_to_int`, `nat_to_int` |
| `domain_is_predicate` | Boolean predicates | `float_is_nan`, `float_is_infinite` |
| Prefix-less | Math universals and float constants only | `abs`, `min`, `max`, `floor`, `ceil`, `round`, `sqrt`, `pow`, `nan`, `infinity` |

**String operations always use `string_` prefix** — `string_contains`, `string_starts_with`, `string_split`, `string_join`, `string_strip`, `string_upper`, `string_lower`, `string_replace`, `string_index_of`, `string_char_code`, `string_from_char_code`, `string_chars`, `string_lines`, `string_words`, `string_reverse`, `string_trim_start`, `string_trim_end`, `string_pad_start`, `string_pad_end`. **Character classifiers use `is_` prefix** — `is_digit`, `is_alpha`, `is_alphanumeric`, `is_whitespace`, `is_upper`, `is_lower`. **First-character conversion uses `char_` prefix** — `char_to_upper`, `char_to_lower`. **JSON typed accessors use `json_as_` and `json_get_` prefixes** — `json_as_string`/`number`/`bool`/`int`/`array`/`object` for Layer-1 coercions; `json_get_string`/`number`/`bool`/`int`/`array` for Layer-2 compound field accessors. **Float64 predicates use `float_` prefix** — `float_is_nan`, `float_is_infinite`. **Type conversions use `source_to_target`** — `int_to_float` (not `to_float`), `float_to_int`, `int_to_nat`. Math functions (`abs`, `min`, `max`, etc.) and float constants (`nan`, `infinity`) are the **only** exceptions — they need no prefix because they are universally understood mathematical names.

**If `vera check` reports an unresolved function name, apply these patterns to derive the correct name before giving up.** The convention is strict and consistent — the right name is always derivable. Do not invent names that don't follow the pattern; they will not exist.

### Option and Result Combinators

The standard prelude provides `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` along with combinator functions that are always available:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Option/Result combinator usage examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
-- Option: unwrap with default
option_unwrap_or(Some(42), 0)           -- returns 42
option_unwrap_or(None, 0)               -- returns 0

-- Option: transform the value inside Some
option_map(Some(10), fn(@Int -> @Int) effects(pure) { @Int.0 + 1 })
-- returns Some(11)

-- Option: chain fallible operations (flatmap)
option_and_then(Some(5), fn(@Int -> @Option<Int>) effects(pure) {
  if @Int.0 > 0 then { Some(@Int.0 * 2) } else { None }
})
-- returns Some(10)

-- Result: unwrap with default
result_unwrap_or(Ok(42), 0)             -- returns 42
result_unwrap_or(Err("oops"), 0)        -- returns 0

-- Result: transform the Ok value
result_map(Ok(10), fn(@Int -> @Int) effects(pure) { @Int.0 + 1 })
-- returns Ok(11)
```

These are generic functions that follow the `domain_verb` naming convention. They are automatically injected and undergo normal monomorphization. If you define a function with the same name, your definition takes precedence.

### Array operations

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Array built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
array_length(@Array<Int>.0)             -- returns Nat (the array length, flows to either Nat or Int positions)
array_append(@Array<Int>.0, @Int.0)     -- returns Array<Int> (new array with element appended)
array_range(@Int.0, @Int.1)             -- returns Array<Int> (integers [start, end))
array_concat(@Array<Int>.0, @Array<Int>.1)  -- returns Array<Int> (merge two arrays)
array_slice(@Array<Int>.0, @Int.0, @Int.1)  -- returns Array<Int> (elements [start, end))
array_map(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int -> @Int) effects(pure) { ... })     -- returns Array<Int>
array_filter(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int -> @Bool) effects(pure) { ... }) -- returns Array<Int>
array_fold(@Array<Int>.0, 0, fn(@Int, @Int -> @Int) effects(pure) { @Int.1 + @Int.0 }) -- returns Int
array_mapi(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int, @Nat -> @Int) effects(pure) { ... }) -- returns Array<Int> (map with index)
array_reverse(@Array<Int>.0)                                         -- returns Array<Int> (element order reversed)
array_find(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int -> @Bool) effects(pure) { ... })   -- returns Option<Int> (first match)
array_any(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int -> @Bool) effects(pure) { ... })    -- returns Bool (at least one match)
array_all(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int -> @Bool) effects(pure) { ... })    -- returns Bool (every element matches)
array_flatten(@Array<Array<Int>>.0)                                  -- returns Array<Int> (one level)
array_sort_by(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int, @Int -> @Ordering) effects(pure) { ... }) -- returns Array<Int>
```

`array_map` / `array_mapi` are generic: the element type can change (e.g. `array_map(@Array<Int>.0, fn(@Int -> @String) ...)`).
`array_fold` is generic: the accumulator type can differ from the element type.
`array_mapi` passes the zero-based index as a `@Nat` second argument — use this rather than hand-rolling a recursive accumulator with an index counter.
`array_find` short-circuits on the first match; `array_any` and `array_all` do the same and observe the standard vacuous-truth convention on empty input (`any([], _) == false`, `all([], _) == true`).
`array_sort_by`'s comparator returns `@Ordering` (`Less` / `Equal` / `Greater`); insertion sort, stable.

`array_sort<T> where Ord<T>`, `array_contains<T> where Eq<T>`, and `array_index_of<T> where Eq<T>` (operations that would dispatch on the element type's built-in ability) are not yet implemented — use `array_sort_by` with an explicit comparator, or `array_any` / `array_find` with an equality predicate, until that infrastructure lands.

### Map operations

`Map<K, V>` is a key-value collection. Keys must satisfy `Eq` and `Hash` abilities (primitive types: `Int`, `Nat`, `Bool`, `Float64`, `String`, `Byte`). Values may be any type with a runtime representation — a zero-size key or value type (`Unit`, or a `Future` wrapping one) is rejected at check time with E135. All operations are pure — insert and remove return new maps.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Map built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
map_insert(map_new(), "hello", 42)                  -- returns Map<String, Nat>
map_insert(@Map<String, Nat>.0, "world", 7)         -- returns Map<String, Nat> (new map with entry added)
map_get(@Map<String, Nat>.0, "hello")               -- returns Option<Nat> (Some(42) or None)
map_contains(@Map<String, Nat>.0, "hello")          -- returns Bool
map_remove(@Map<String, Nat>.0, "hello")            -- returns Map<String, Nat> (new map without key)
map_size(@Map<String, Nat>.0)                       -- returns Int (number of entries)
map_keys(@Map<String, Nat>.0)                       -- returns Array<String>
map_values(@Map<String, Nat>.0)                     -- returns Array<Nat>
```

> `map_new()` is a zero-argument generic function. Nest it inside `map_insert(map_new(), k, v)` so that type inference can resolve the key and value types from the arguments. Using `option_unwrap_or(map_get(...), default)` is the idiomatic way to extract values with a fallback.

### Set operations

`Set<T>` is an unordered collection of unique elements. Elements must satisfy `Eq` and `Hash` abilities (primitive types: `Int`, `Nat`, `Bool`, `Float64`, `String`, `Byte`); a zero-size element type (`Unit`, or a `Future` wrapping one) is rejected at check time with E135. All operations are pure — add and remove return new sets.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Set built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
set_add(set_add(set_new(), "hello"), "world")       -- returns Set<String>
set_contains(@Set<String>.0, "hello")               -- returns Bool (true)
set_remove(@Set<String>.0, "hello")                 -- returns Set<String> (new set without element)
set_size(@Set<String>.0)                            -- returns Int
set_to_array(@Set<String>.0)                        -- returns Array<String>
```

> `set_new()` is a zero-argument generic function. Nest it inside `set_add(set_new(), elem)` so that type inference can resolve the element type. Adding a duplicate element is a no-op (sets enforce uniqueness).

### Decimal operations

`Decimal` provides exact decimal arithmetic for financial and precision-sensitive applications. It is an opaque type (i32 handle) backed by the runtime's decimal implementation. All operations are pure.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Decimal built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
decimal_from_int(42)                                -- returns Decimal (exact conversion)
decimal_from_float(3.14)                            -- returns Decimal (via str conversion)
decimal_add(@Decimal.0, @Decimal.1)                 -- returns Decimal (addition)
decimal_sub(@Decimal.0, @Decimal.1)                 -- returns Decimal (subtraction)
decimal_mul(@Decimal.0, @Decimal.1)                 -- returns Decimal (multiplication)
decimal_neg(@Decimal.0)                             -- returns Decimal (negation)
decimal_abs(@Decimal.0)                             -- returns Decimal (absolute value)
decimal_round(@Decimal.0, 2)                        -- returns Decimal (round to N places)
decimal_eq(@Decimal.0, @Decimal.1)                  -- returns Bool (equality)
decimal_compare(@Decimal.0, @Decimal.1)             -- returns Ordering (Less/Equal/Greater)
decimal_to_string(@Decimal.0)                       -- returns String
decimal_to_float(@Decimal.0)                        -- returns Float64 (potentially lossy)
```

`decimal_from_string` and `decimal_div` return `Option<Decimal>` — use `option_unwrap_or` or `match` to extract the value. `decimal_compare` returns `Ordering` — use `match` to dispatch on `Less`, `Equal`, `Greater`.

### JSON operations

`Json` is a built-in ADT for structured data interchange. Parse JSON strings, query fields and array elements, and serialize back to strings. All operations are pure.

The `Json` type has six constructors: `JNull`, `JBool(Bool)`, `JNumber(Float64)`, `JString(String)`, `JArray(Array<Json>)`, `JObject(Map<String, Json>)`. It is provided by the standard prelude — no `data` declaration needed.

**What `json_parse` accepts.** Exactly RFC 8259-valid text that decodes to finite numbers and strings of Unicode scalar values (spec §9.7.1). Anything else is `Err`, at the parse, with the same message on the CLI and in the browser — Vera defines this domain rather than inheriting whichever one the host parser implements. Two consequences are worth knowing before you write the `Err` arm:

- A **non-finite number** never parses, however it is written. The constants `NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are not JSON at all; a number that merely *overflows*, like `1e999`, is syntactically fine and still refused, because what it decodes to is an infinity. Underflow is different — `1e-999` gives you `0` and parses. If a producer you do not control emits any of these, fix the producer or pre-process the text; there is no flag to admit them.
- A **lone surrogate** escape (`\ud800` with no matching partner) never parses either: its decoded value is not a Unicode scalar, and a Vera `String` is. A *matched* pair is ordinary — `"\ud83d\ude00"` parses fine and gives you the astral character.

Everything else that fails is a plain syntax error, and that message is the host parser's own.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="JSON parse/stringify/get examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
json_parse("{\"name\":\"Vera\"}")               -- returns Result<Json, String>
json_stringify(@Json.0)                          -- returns String (JSON text)
json_get(@Json.0, "name")                        -- returns Option<Json> (field lookup)
json_has_field(@Json.0, "name")                  -- returns Bool
json_keys(@Json.0)                               -- returns Array<String> (object keys)
json_array_get(@Json.0, 0)                       -- returns Option<Json> (element at index)
json_array_length(@Json.0)                       -- returns Int (array length, 0 if not array)
json_type(@Json.0)                               -- returns String ("null"/"bool"/"number"/"string"/"array"/"object")
```

Pattern match on `Json` constructors to extract values:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="JSON match expression example, bare expression" -->
```vera
match json_parse("{\"x\":42}") {
  Err(@String) -> Err(@String.0),
  Ok(@Json) -> match json_get(@Json.0, "x") {
    None -> Err("missing x"),
    Some(@Json) -> match @Json.0 {
      JNumber(@Float64) -> Ok(float_to_int(@Float64.0)),
      _ -> Err("x is not a number")
    }
  }
}
```

#### Typed accessors (Layer 1 and Layer 2)

For the common case of "unwrap `Option<Json>` and match on a specific constructor", use the typed accessors instead of the two-level match above:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="JSON typed accessor examples (#366), bare calls" -->
```vera
-- Layer 1: Json -> Option<T>.  Some when the constructor matches.
json_as_string(@Json.0)   -- Option<String>
json_as_number(@Json.0)   -- Option<Float64>
json_as_bool(@Json.0)     -- Option<Bool>
json_as_int(@Json.0)      -- Option<Int>     (truncates; None for NaN/inf/|f| >= 2^63)
json_as_array(@Json.0)    -- Option<Array<Json>>
json_as_object(@Json.0)   -- Option<Map<String, Json>>

-- Layer 2: json_get + json_as_* composed (the common pattern).
json_get_string(@Json.0, "name")   -- Option<String>
json_get_number(@Json.0, "score")  -- Option<Float64>
json_get_bool(@Json.0, "active")   -- Option<Bool>
json_get_int(@Json.0, "age")       -- Option<Int>
json_get_array(@Json.0, "tags")    -- Option<Array<Json>>
```

The Layer-2 accessors return `None` both when the field is missing AND when the field is present but of the wrong type — exactly what 90% of real API-consuming code wants. The example above collapses to:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="JSON Layer-2 compound accessor example, bare match" -->
```vera
match json_parse("{\"x\":42}") {
  Err(@String) -> Err(@String.0),
  Ok(@Json) -> match json_get_int(@Json.0, "x") {
    Some(@Int) -> Ok(@Int.0),
    None -> Err("x missing or not a number")
  }
}
```

### String operations

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="String built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
string_length(@String.0)                -- returns Nat
string_concat(@String.0, @String.1)     -- returns String
string_slice(@String.0, @Nat.0, @Nat.1) -- returns String (start, end)

md_parse(@String.0)                     -- returns Result<MdBlock, String> (parse Markdown)
md_render(@MdBlock.0)                   -- returns String (render to canonical Markdown)
md_has_heading(@MdBlock.0, @Nat.0)      -- returns Bool (check if heading of level exists)
md_has_code_block(@MdBlock.0, @String.0) -- returns Bool (check if code block of language exists)
md_extract_code_blocks(@MdBlock.0, @String.0) -- returns Array<String> (extract code by language)
html_parse(@String.0)                  -- returns Result<HtmlNode, String> (parse HTML)
html_to_string(@HtmlNode.0)            -- returns String (serialize to HTML)
html_query(@HtmlNode.0, @String.0)     -- returns Array<HtmlNode> (CSS selector query)

await(@Future<T>.0)                    -- returns T (requires effects(<Async>))
to_string(@Int.0)                       -- returns String (integer to decimal)
int_to_string(@Int.0)                   -- returns String (alias for to_string)
bool_to_string(@Bool.0)                 -- returns String ("true" or "false")
nat_to_string(@Nat.0)                   -- returns String (natural to decimal)
byte_to_string(@Byte.0)                 -- returns String (single character)
float_to_string(@Float64.0)             -- returns String (decimal; total: nan/inf/-inf for non-finite)
string_strip(@String.0)                 -- returns String (trim whitespace)
```

#### String interpolation

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="String interpolation examples, bare expressions" -->
```vera
"hello \(@String.0)"               -- embeds a String value
"x = \(@Int.0)"                    -- auto-converts Int to String
"a=\(@Int.1), b=\(@Int.0)"        -- multiple interpolations
"\(@String.0)"                     -- interpolation-only (no literal text)
"len=\(string_length(@String.0))"  -- function call inside interpolation
```

Expressions inside `\(...)` are auto-converted to String for types: Int, Nat, Bool, Byte, Float64. Other types produce error E148. Expressions cannot contain string literals (use `let` bindings instead).

#### String search

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="String search built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
string_contains(@String.0, @String.1)  -- returns Bool (substring test)
string_starts_with(@String.0, @String.1) -- returns Bool (prefix test)
string_ends_with(@String.0, @String.1)   -- returns Bool (suffix test)
string_index_of(@String.0, @String.1)    -- returns Option<Nat> (first occurrence)
```

`string_contains` checks whether the needle appears anywhere in the haystack. `string_starts_with` and `string_ends_with` test prefix and suffix matches. `string_index_of` returns `Some(i)` with the byte offset of the first match, or `None` if not found. An empty needle always matches (returns `true` or `Some(0)`).

#### String transformation

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="String transformation built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
string_upper(@String.0)                         -- returns String (ASCII uppercase)
string_lower(@String.0)                         -- returns String (ASCII lowercase)
string_replace(@String.0, @String.1, @String.2) -- returns String (replace all)
string_split(@String.0, @String.1)              -- returns Array<String> (split by delimiter)
string_join(@Array<String>.0, @String.0)        -- returns String (join with separator)
```

`string_upper` and `string_lower` convert ASCII letters only (a-z ↔ A-Z). `string_replace` substitutes all non-overlapping occurrences; an empty needle returns the original string unchanged. `string_split` returns an array of segments; an empty delimiter returns a single-element array. `string_join` concatenates array elements with the separator between each pair.

#### String utilities and character classification

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="String utility / classifier signatures (#470, #471), bare calls" -->
```vera
-- Splits (bridge to the array combinators)
string_chars(@String.0)                            -- returns Array<String> (one byte each)
string_lines(@String.0)                            -- returns Array<String> (\n, \r\n, \r)
string_words(@String.0)                            -- returns Array<String> (whitespace runs)

-- Transformations
string_reverse(@String.0)                          -- returns String (byte reverse)
string_trim_start(@String.0)                       -- returns String (lstrip whitespace)
string_trim_end(@String.0)                         -- returns String (rstrip whitespace)
string_pad_start(@String.0, @Nat.0, @String.1)     -- returns String (left-pad to length, JS padStart)
string_pad_end(@String.0, @Nat.0, @String.1)       -- returns String (right-pad to length)

-- Case conversion (first byte only)
char_to_upper(@String.0)                           -- returns String
char_to_lower(@String.0)                           -- returns String

-- Character classifiers (first byte; false for empty)
is_digit(@String.0)                                -- returns Bool ('0'..'9')
is_alpha(@String.0)                                -- returns Bool ('A'..'Z', 'a'..'z')
is_alphanumeric(@String.0)                         -- returns Bool
is_whitespace(@String.0)                           -- returns Bool (tab, LF, VT, FF, CR, space — Python isspace() ASCII)
is_upper(@String.0)                                -- returns Bool
is_lower(@String.0)                                -- returns Bool
```

`string_chars` is the canonical bridge from `String` to `Array<String>` — combine with `array_map`, `array_filter`, `array_fold` to thread per-byte logic through the array combinators. `string_lines` follows Python's `splitlines()` (trailing `\n` does not add an empty segment). `string_words` follows Python's `split()` with no args (runs collapse, empty segments discarded).

`string_pad_start` and `string_pad_end` cycle the fill left-to-right and truncate to exactly the padding length, matching JavaScript's `padStart` / `padEnd`. If the input is already at least `n` bytes, the input is returned unchanged. An empty `fill` is a no-op.

`char_to_upper` / `char_to_lower` convert only the **first byte** of the string; remaining bytes pass through unchanged. Useful for title-casing a token. The six classifiers all inspect only the first byte and return `false` for the empty string. All sixteen are ASCII-only — no Unicode awareness.

String functions use the heap allocator (`$alloc`). Memory is managed automatically by a conservative mark-sweep garbage collector — there is no manual allocation or deallocation. All four parse functions return `Result<T, String>`: `parse_nat`, `parse_int`, `parse_float64`, and `parse_bool`. They return `Ok(value)` on valid input and `Err(msg)` on empty or invalid input; leading and trailing spaces are tolerated. `parse_int` accepts an optional `+` or `-` sign. `parse_bool` is strict: only `"true"` and `"false"` (lowercase) are valid. `base64_encode` encodes a string to standard Base64 (RFC 4648); `base64_decode` returns `Result<String, String>`, failing on invalid length or characters. `url_encode` percent-encodes a string for use in URLs (RFC 3986), leaving unreserved characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`, `.`, `~`) unchanged; `url_decode` returns `Result<String, String>`, failing on invalid `%XX` sequences. `url_parse` decomposes a URL into its RFC 3986 components, returning `Result<UrlParts, String>` where `UrlParts(scheme, authority, path, query, fragment)` is a built-in ADT with five String fields; it returns `Err("missing scheme")` if no `:` is found. `url_join` reassembles a `UrlParts` value into a URL string. Programs must redefine `UrlParts` locally (like `Result`) to use it in match expressions.

### Markdown operations

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="md_parse / md_render signatures, bare calls" -->
```vera
md_parse(@String.0)                     -- returns Result<MdBlock, String>
md_render(@MdBlock.0)                   -- returns String
md_has_heading(@MdBlock.0, @Nat.0)      -- returns Bool
md_has_code_block(@MdBlock.0, @String.0) -- returns Bool
md_extract_code_blocks(@MdBlock.0, @String.0) -- returns Array<String>
```

`md_parse` parses a Markdown string into a typed `MdBlock` document tree. Returns `Ok(MdDocument(...))` on success. `md_render` converts an `MdBlock` back to canonical Markdown text. `md_has_heading` checks whether the document contains a heading at the given level (1–6). `md_has_code_block` checks for a fenced code block with the given language tag (use `""` for untagged blocks). `md_extract_code_blocks` returns an array of code content strings for all blocks matching the language.

Two built-in ADTs represent the Markdown document structure:

**MdInline** — inline content within blocks:
- `MdText(String)` — plain text
- `MdCode(String)` — inline code
- `MdEmph(Array<MdInline>)` — emphasis (*italic*)
- `MdStrong(Array<MdInline>)` — strong (**bold**)
- `MdLink(Array<MdInline>, String)` — link with text and URL
- `MdImage(String, String)` — image with alt text and source

**MdBlock** — block-level content:
- `MdParagraph(Array<MdInline>)` — paragraph
- `MdHeading(Nat, Array<MdInline>)` — heading with level (1–6)
- `MdCodeBlock(String, String)` — fenced code block (language, code)
- `MdBlockQuote(Array<MdBlock>)` — block quote
- `MdList(Bool, Array<Array<MdBlock>>)` — list (ordered?, items)
- `MdThematicBreak` — horizontal rule
- `MdTable(Array<Array<Array<MdInline>>>)` — table (rows of cells)
- `MdDocument(Array<MdBlock>)` — top-level document

All Markdown functions are pure and available without imports. Pattern match on `MdBlock` and `MdInline` constructors to traverse the document tree.

### HTML operations

`HtmlNode` is a built-in ADT for parsing and querying HTML documents. Parse HTML strings, query elements with CSS selectors, and extract text content. All operations are pure.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="HTML built-in examples (html_parse/html_query/etc.), bare calls" -->
```vera
html_parse(@String.0)                    -- returns Result<HtmlNode, String> (parse HTML)
html_to_string(@HtmlNode.0)             -- returns String (serialize to HTML)
html_query(@HtmlNode.0, @String.0)      -- returns Array<HtmlNode> (CSS selector query)
html_text(@HtmlNode.0)                  -- returns String (extract text content)
html_attr(@HtmlNode.0, @String.0)       -- returns Option<String> (get attribute value)
```

`html_parse` is lenient (like browsers) — malformed HTML produces a best-effort tree, not an error. `html_query` supports simple CSS selectors: tag name (`div`), class (`.classname`), ID (`#id`), attribute presence (`[href]`), and descendant combinator (`div p`). `html_text` recursively concatenates all text content, excluding comments. `html_attr` returns `None` for non-element nodes or missing attributes.

**HtmlNode constructors:**

- `HtmlElement(String, Map<String, String>, Array<HtmlNode>)` — element (tag name, attributes, children)
- `HtmlText(String)` — text content
- `HtmlComment(String)` — HTML comment

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="HTML constructor match expression, bare expression" -->
```vera
let @Result<HtmlNode, String> = html_parse("<div><a href=\"url\">link</a></div>");
match @Result<HtmlNode, String>.0 {
  Ok(@HtmlNode) -> {
    let @Array<HtmlNode> = html_query(@HtmlNode.0, "a");
    IO.print(int_to_string(array_length(@Array<HtmlNode>.0)))
  },
  Err(@String) -> IO.print(@String.0)
}
```

All HTML functions are pure and available without imports. Pattern match on `HtmlNode` constructors to traverse the document tree.

### Regular expressions

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Regex built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
regex_match(@String.0, @String.1)                -- returns Result<Bool, String>
regex_find(@String.0, @String.1)                 -- returns Result<Option<String>, String>
regex_find_all(@String.0, @String.1)             -- returns Result<Array<String>, String>
regex_replace(@String.0, @String.1, @String.2)   -- returns Result<String, String>
```

All four regex functions take the input string as the first argument and the regex pattern as the second. `regex_replace` takes a third argument for the replacement string. All return `Result` types — `Err(msg)` for invalid patterns, `Ok(value)` on success.

`regex_match` tests whether the pattern matches anywhere in the input (substring match, not full-string). `regex_find` returns the first matching substring wrapped in `Option`. `regex_find_all` returns all non-overlapping matches as an `Array<String>` — always returns full match strings (group 0), even when the pattern contains capture groups. `regex_replace` replaces only the **first** match.

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Regex Result matching example, bare expression" -->
```vera
let @Result<Bool, String> = regex_match("hello123", "\\d+");
match @Result<Bool, String>.0 {
  Ok(@Bool) -> if @Bool.0 then { IO.print("found digits") } else { IO.print("no digits") },
  Err(@String) -> IO.print(string_concat("Error: ", @String.0))
}
```

All regex functions are pure and implemented as host imports (Python `re` / JavaScript `RegExp`).

### Numeric operations

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Numeric built-in examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
abs(@Int.0)                         -- returns Nat (absolute value)
min(@Int.0, @Int.1)                 -- returns Int (smaller of two)
max(@Int.0, @Int.1)                 -- returns Int (larger of two)
floor(@Float64.0)                   -- returns Int (round down)
ceil(@Float64.0)                    -- returns Int (round up)
round(@Float64.0)                   -- returns Int (banker's rounding)
sqrt(@Float64.0)                    -- returns Float64 (square root)
pow(@Float64.0, @Int.0)             -- returns Float64 (exponentiation)
```

`abs` returns `Nat` because absolute values are non-negative. `floor`, `ceil`, and `round` convert `Float64` to `Int`; they trap on NaN or out-of-range values (WASM semantics). `round` uses IEEE 754 roundTiesToEven (banker's rounding): `round(2.5)` is `2`, not `3`. `pow` takes an `Int` exponent — negative exponents produce reciprocals (`pow(2.0, -1)` is `0.5`). The integer builtins (`abs`, `min`, `max`) are fully verifiable by the SMT solver (Tier 1). The float builtins fall to Tier 3 (runtime).

### Logarithmic, trigonometric, and numeric utility functions

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Math built-in examples (log/trig/constants/clamp), bare calls" -->
```vera
log(@Float64.0)                     -- natural logarithm (base e)
log2(@Float64.0)                    -- base-2 logarithm
log10(@Float64.0)                   -- base-10 logarithm
sin(@Float64.0)                     -- sine (radians)
cos(@Float64.0)                     -- cosine (radians)
tan(@Float64.0)                     -- tangent (radians)
asin(@Float64.0)                    -- inverse sine, returns [-π/2, π/2]
acos(@Float64.0)                    -- inverse cosine, returns [0, π]
atan(@Float64.0)                    -- inverse tangent, returns (-π/2, π/2)
atan2(@Float64.0, @Float64.1)       -- quadrant-correct angle from (y, x)
pi()                                -- 3.141592653589793
e()                                 -- 2.718281828459045
sign(@Int.0)                        -- returns Int: -1, 0, or 1
clamp(@Int.0, @Int.1, @Int.2)       -- clamp(v, lo, hi) -> Int
float_clamp(@Float64.0, @Float64.1, @Float64.2)  -- Float64 clamp
```

All log and trig functions follow IEEE 754 semantics: `NaN` for out-of-domain inputs (e.g. `log(-1.0)`, `asin(2.0)`), `±Infinity` for overflow. The logarithms' zero pole is not a domain error: `log(0.0)` / `log2(0.0)` / `log10(0.0)` return `-Infinity` in both runtimes (#790). The argument order for `atan2` is `(y, x)`, matching POSIX / Python / JavaScript — `atan2(1.0, 1.0)` is `π/4`. `sign` and `clamp` are inlined as WAT (no host call). `pi()` and `e()` inline as `f64.const` constants. The log and trig functions fall to Tier 3 verification (they're uninterpreted in Z3's real-arithmetic fragment).

### Type conversions

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Type conversions, bare calls" -->
```vera
int_to_float(@Int.0)                -- returns Float64 (int to float)
float_to_int(@Float64.0)           -- returns Int (truncation toward zero)
nat_to_int(@Nat.0)                 -- returns Int (guarded: traps if @Nat > i64.MAX)
int_to_nat(@Int.0)                 -- returns Option<Nat> (None if negative)
byte_to_int(@Byte.0)              -- returns Int (zero-extension)
int_to_byte(@Int.0)               -- returns Option<Byte> (None if out of 0..255)
```

Vera has no implicit numeric conversions — use these functions to convert between numeric types. `int_to_float` and `byte_to_int` are widening conversions that always succeed (a `@Byte` is `0..255`, always in i64 range). `nat_to_int` widens `@Nat → @Int`, but a `@Nat` above i64.MAX bit-reinterprets to a negative `@Int`, so — like the implicit `@Nat → @Int` coercion — it carries a `<= i64.MAX` obligation (`E530`): Tier 1 when the value is provably bounded, otherwise a runtime trap (`vera run` traps rather than silently returning the reinterpreted value). `float_to_int` truncates toward zero and traps on NaN/Infinity. `int_to_nat` and `int_to_byte` are checked narrowing conversions that return `Option` — pattern match on the result to handle the failure case. `byte_to_int` is SMT-verifiable (Tier 1); the rest are Tier 3 (runtime).

`Byte` is excluded from arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, unary `-`) at type-check time — `@Byte.0 + @Byte.1` produces `E140`. For byte-level math, convert to `Int` via `byte_to_int`, do the arithmetic in `@Int`, and convert back via `int_to_byte` if needed. The forward-looking design question of allowing direct `@Byte` arithmetic (with verified underflow + overflow guards) is tracked speculatively as [#564](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/564); the current convention keeps the verifier's range-checking story focused on `@Nat` (where only underflow can occur).

### Float64 predicates

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Float64 predicate and constant examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
float_is_nan(@Float64.0)           -- returns Bool (true if NaN)
float_is_infinite(@Float64.0)      -- returns Bool (true if ±infinity)
nan()                              -- returns Float64 (quiet NaN)
infinity()                         -- returns Float64 (positive infinity)
```

`float_is_nan` and `float_is_infinite` test for IEEE 754 special values. `nan()` and `infinity()` construct them — use `0.0 - infinity()` for negative infinity. All four are Tier 3 (runtime-tested, not SMT-verifiable).

**Float postconditions are near the solver's ceiling.** Contract predicates over `@Float64` are discharged against Z3's IEEE-754 sort, which costs roughly an order of magnitude more solver time than the integer equivalent of the same shape — a two-branch absolute difference runs to several seconds where the `@Int` version takes a fraction of one. Shapes that land near the default per-query budget (10 s) are therefore host-sensitive: the same program can report Tier 1 on a fast machine and Tier 3 on a slow or busy one. When a float contract falls to Tier 3, re-run it with a larger budget — `vera verify --timeout-ms 60000 file.vera`, or `VERA_Z3_TIMEOUT_MS` for a whole session — before concluding anything: a claim that proves with more time needed time, while one that stays Tier 3 at any budget is standing behind something the solver cannot see through at all, such as `sqrt` or `asin`. Only the second kind is a reason to restate the contract.

**Redeclaring a built-in effect is an error (E152)**: an `effect IO { ... }` block — or `State<T>`, `Exn<E>`, `Http`, `Random`, `Inference`, `DB`, `Diverge`, `Async`, `HttpServer` — is rejected at `vera check`, whether or not its operation signatures match the built-in. The operations come with the effect row: write `effects(<IO>)` on the function and call `IO.print(...)`. Beyond one canonical form, the block cannot be honoured — code generation routes a qualified `IO.op(...)` to the fixed host import by qualifier name and never reads the declaration, so a divergent signature used to compile to invalid WebAssembly that trapped at `run`. Give a genuinely different effect a distinct name (e.g. `Logger`).

**Redefining a built-in is an error (E151)**: a function whose name matches a built-in (e.g. `abs`, `array_length`, `clamp`, `to_string`) is rejected at `vera check`. Built-ins are always in scope as the single canonical definition, so a second one is both redundant (one canonical form) and — for the verifier-modelled built-ins — silently unsound: the verifier would reason with the built-in's model while codegen runs your body. Call the built-in directly (no import needed), or give your function a distinct name (e.g. `magnitude`) for genuinely different behaviour. The one exception is the prelude's Option/Result/Json/Html *combinators* (`option_map`, `option_and_then`, `option_unwrap_or`, `result_map`, `result_unwrap_or`, `json_*`, `html_attr`): these are ordinary Vera functions the prelude injects, so a same-named user definition soundly replaces them.

**Reserved function names (E153)**: three groups of identifier cannot be a function name — two the grammar claims in expression position, and one the checker binds. `old` and `new` are contract state forms, so `old(...)` / `new(...)` always parses as a reference to an effect's before/after state (Chapter 7, Section 7.9.2) and never as a call. `assert`, `assume`, `forall`, `exists`, `match`, `if`, `let`, `fn`, `true` and `false` are keywords the lexer admits as a name after `fn` but reads as the keyword everywhere else, so `match(3)` in a body does not parse as a call either. A function under any of these — top-level, `where`-helper, or in an imported module — could never be called, and is rejected at `vera check`. Rename it. `resume` is reserved as well, for a different reason: it is not a keyword and a declaration does parse, but inside every handler clause body `resume` is the resumption operator, so declaring a function of that name would give one spelling two meanings by position. The rejection is the whole story: a clause body in the same file still resolves `resume` to the operator, so the rejected declaration draws no second error. Writing `resume(...)` inside a handler clause is unaffected. Only the exact identifiers are reserved: `older`, `renew`, `matched`, `resumed` and the like are ordinary function names. `handle` is the one keyword still available, because `public fn handle(@Request -> @Response)` is the entry point `vera serve` invokes from the host (Chapter 9, Section 9.5.6).

Example:

```vera
private fn greet(@String -> @String)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  string_concat("Hello, ", @String.0)
}
```

## Contracts

### requires (preconditions)

Conditions that must hold when the function is called:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Requires clause example, not full function" -->
```vera
private fn safe_divide(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(@Int.1 != 0)
```

### ensures (postconditions)

Conditions guaranteed when the function returns. Use `@T.result` to refer to the return value:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Ensures clause example, not full function" -->
```vera
  ensures(@Int.result == @Int.0 / @Int.1)
```

### decreases (termination)

Required on **pure** recursive functions: the expression must strictly decrease on each recursive call so Z3 can discharge termination.  Effectful recursive functions (`<IO>`, `<State>`, `<Http>`, etc.) do **not** require `decreases` — see the FizzBuzz example in the [Iteration](#iteration) section, which loops over `<IO>` recursively without one.

```vera
private fn factorial(@Nat -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Nat.result >= 1)
  decreases(@Nat.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Nat.0 == 0 then {
    1
  } else {
    @Nat.0 * factorial(@Nat.0 - 1)
  }
}
```

For nested recursion, use lexicographic ordering: `decreases(@Nat.0, @Nat.1)`.

The measure must have a well-founded ordering — `Nat`, `Int`, a data type (ordered by structural size), or a lexicographic tuple of these; a `Float64`/`String`/`Bool` measure is rejected at check time (`E127`). A measure Z3 cannot prove is checked at run time: a recursive re-entry whose measure fails to strictly decrease (or goes negative) traps with a message naming the function, instead of looping forever. Self-recursive tail calls keep tail-call optimization (the hop is checked at the call site, so guarded iteration still runs at constant stack depth); only *mutually*-recursive tail calls between guarded functions fall back to plain calls. An ADT measure of a *parameterized* type (`List<Int>`) is not yet runtime-ranked, and a function declaring `Exn` gets no runtime guard (a throw would unwind past the state restores) — in both cases the obligation stays disclosed at the static tier.

### Workflow: writing contracts incrementally

**Start with scaffolding, then strengthen.** A function with placeholder contracts type-checks
and compiles:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Contracts scaffolding template" -->
```vera
requires(true) ensures(true)
```

Fill in real contracts *after* the body type-checks cleanly. Strengthen in this order:

1. Write `requires(true) ensures(true)` and run `vera check` — confirm the body is correct first.
2. Add a `requires` condition for each invariant the caller must satisfy.
3. Add an `ensures` condition describing what the function guarantees. Use `@T.result` for the
   return value.
4. Run `vera verify` — **not just `vera check`** — to confirm contracts are statically provable.
   `vera check` only type-checks; `vera verify` runs Z3.
5. If `vera verify` reports a contract will be checked at runtime (Tier 3), the Z3 solver could
   not prove it. Add a `decreases` clause for recursive functions, or simplify the contract
   expression.
6. Run `vera test` to find counterexamples. If `vera test` reports a failure, the contract is
   reachable and the function body is wrong.

### Quantified expressions

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Quantified expression examples, bare calls" -->
```vera
-- For all indices in [0, bound):
forall(@Nat, array_length(@Array<Int>.0), fn(@Nat -> @Bool) effects(pure) {
  @Array<Int>.0[@Nat.0] > 0
})

-- There exists an index in [0, bound):
exists(@Nat, array_length(@Array<Int>.0), fn(@Nat -> @Bool) effects(pure) {
  @Array<Int>.0[@Nat.0] == 0
})
```

## Effects

Vera is pure by default. All side effects must be declared.

### Declaring effects on functions

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Effect declarations list" -->
```vera
effects(pure)                    -- no effects
effects(<IO>)                    -- performs IO
effects(<Http>)                  -- network access
effects(<State<Int>>)            -- uses integer state
effects(<State<Int>, IO>)        -- multiple effects
effects(<Http, IO>)              -- network + IO
effects(<Async>)                 -- async computation
effects(<HttpServer>)            -- HTTP request handler (vera serve)
effects(<Random>)                -- non-deterministic (random number generation)
effects(<DB>)                    -- SQL database access
effects(<Diverge>)               -- may not terminate
effects(<Diverge, IO>)           -- divergent with IO
```

`Diverge` is a built-in marker effect with no operations. Its presence in the
effect row signals that the function may not terminate. Functions without
`Diverge` must be proven total (via `decreases` clauses on recursion).

### Effect declarations

The IO effect is built-in — no declaration is needed. It provides eleven operations:

| Operation | Signature | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `IO.print` | `String -> Unit` | Print a string to stdout (no implicit newline; flushes per call) |
| `IO.read_line` | `Unit -> String` | Read a line from stdin |
| `IO.read_char` | `Unit -> Result<String, String>` | Read one character from stdin — cbreak mode on a Unix TTY, where Ctrl-D gives `Err("EOF")`; redirected input reads one character from the stdin stream and gives `Err("EOF")` at end of input.  Browser target not yet supported — depends on JSPI ([#609](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/609)) for suspend/resume. |
| `IO.read_file` | `String -> Result<String, String>` | Read file contents |
| `IO.write_file` | `String, String -> Result<Unit, String>` | Write string to file |
| `IO.args` | `Unit -> Array<String>` | Get command-line arguments |
| `IO.exit` | `Int -> Never` | Exit with status code |
| `IO.get_env` | `String -> Option<String>` | Read environment variable |
| `IO.sleep` | `Nat -> Unit` | Pause execution for N milliseconds |
| `IO.time` | `Unit -> Nat` | Current Unix time in milliseconds |
| `IO.stderr` | `String -> Unit` | Print a string to stderr |

Do **not** write an `effect IO { ... }` block: redeclaring a built-in effect is a compile error (`E152`), whether or not the signatures match the built-in. The same holds for `State<T>`, `Exn<E>`, `Http`, `Random`, `Inference`, `DB`, `Diverge`, `Async`, and `HttpServer`. Declaring `effects(<IO>)` on the function is all that is needed — the operations follow from the effect row, so there is exactly one way to write the program.

**Output buffering and live writes.** Under `vera run` text mode, every `IO.print` call writes to `sys.stdout` and flushes immediately — animations, progress bars, REPLs, and any output using ANSI escape sequences (cursor home, clear screen) render in real time. The captured transcript is *also* preserved in memory so that if the program traps, every byte printed before the trap reaches `WasmTrapError.stdout` and the JSON envelope's `stdout` field. Under `vera run --json`, live mirroring is suppressed — the transcript lives only in the JSON envelope, because writing live to stdout would corrupt the envelope for downstream consumers parsing it. Programs do not need to call any "flush" operation; per-call flushing is the contract. Pre-v0.0.123 the whole transcript was buffered until program exit; that behaviour was correct for trap preservation and JSON consumers but made interactive output invisible.

### Performing effects

Call the effect operations directly:

```vera
private fn greet(@String -> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO>)
{
  IO.print(@String.0);
  ()
}

public fn main(-> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO>)
{
  match IO.read_file("data.txt") {
    Ok(@String) -> IO.print(@String.0),
    Err(@String) -> IO.print(@String.0)
  };
  ()
}
```

### State effects

```vera
private fn increment(@Unit -> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(new(State<Int>) == old(State<Int>) + 1)
  effects(<State<Int>>)
{
  let @Int = get(());
  put(@Int.0 + 1);
  ()
}
```

In `ensures` clauses, `old(State<T>)` is the state before the call and `new(State<T>)` is the state after.

### Exception effects

The `Exn<E>` effect models exceptions with error type `E`. It is built-in — no
declaration is needed, and writing one is `E152`. Its single operation is
`throw : E -> Never`, which never resumes.

Throw exceptions using the qualified call syntax:

```vera
private fn safe_div(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<Exn<String>>)
{
  if @Int.1 == 0 then {
    Exn.throw("division by zero")
  } else {
    @Int.0 / @Int.1
  }
}
```

Handle exceptions with `handle[Exn<E>]`:

```vera
private fn try_div(@Int, @Int -> @Option<Int>)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  handle[Exn<String>] {
    throw(@String) -> None
  } in {
    Some(safe_div(@Int.0, @Int.1))
  }
}
```

The handler catches the exception and returns a fallback value. The `throw` handler clause receives the error value and must return the same type as the overall `handle` expression. Exception handlers do not use `resume` — throwing is non-resumable.

### Async effect

The `Async` effect enables asynchronous computation with `Future<T>`:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Async effect row declarations, bare clauses" -->
```vera
effects(<Async>)                 -- async computation
effects(<IO, Async>)             -- async with IO
```

`async` and `await` are built-in generic functions:

```vera
private fn compute(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<Async>)
{
  let @Future<Int> = async(@Int.1 * 2);
  let @Future<Int> = async(@Int.0 * 3);
  await(@Future<Int>.0) + await(@Future<Int>.1)
}
```

`async(expr)` evaluates `expr` and wraps the result in `Future<T>`. `await(@Future<T>.n)` unwraps it.

**Concurrency (#841):** `async(Http.get(url))` and `async(Http.post(url, body))` — with call-free argument expressions — run **concurrently** in the native runtime: the request is issued on a worker thread at the `async(...)` point, and `await` blocks for the response. Fire several, then await them in any order to overlap network latency:

```vera
public fn fan_out(@String, @String -> @Bool)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(<Http, Async>)
{
  let @Future<Result<String, String>> = async(Http.get(@String.1));
  let @Future<Result<String, String>> = async(Http.get(@String.0));
  let @Result<String, String> = await(@Future<Result<String, String>>.1);
  let @Result<String, String> = await(@Future<Result<String, String>>.0);
  true
}
```

Every other `async` shape evaluates eagerly (sequential) — `Future<T>` is then just `T`'s representation with no overhead. The checker warns (`W002`) when the argument's effect row falls outside the commutative whitelist `{Http, Async}` (e.g. an `IO`-effectful call), marking where eager evaluation is semantically required. The browser runtime is always eager (identical values, request fires at the `async` point).

### HttpServer effect

`HttpServer` is a marker effect (no operations) for **verified HTTP request handling** (#305). Define a total handler and serve it with `vera serve prog.vera [--port N]` — the accept loop lives in the host, so no `Diverge` is involved and every contract on the handler is an ordinary obligation. `Request` / `Response` are built-in prelude ADTs:

```vera
public fn handle(@Request -> @Response)
  requires(true) ensures(true) effects(<HttpServer>)
{
  match @Request.0 {
    Request(@String, @String, @Map<String, String>, @String) ->
      Response(200, map_new(), @String.0)
  }
}
```

Request fields: method, path, headers (`Map<String, String>`), body — in the match arm above the String bindings are method (`@String.2`, oldest), path (`@String.1`), body (`@String.0`, most recent). Response fields: status (`Int`), headers, body. Each request runs on a fresh instance (State cannot leak between requests); a runtime contract violation answers 500 with the trap diagnostic. Native-only (no browser serving).

### Http effect

The `Http` effect enables network I/O. It is built-in — no `effect Http { ... }` declaration is needed.

| Operation | Signature | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `Http.get` | `String -> Result<String, String>` | HTTP GET request |
| `Http.post` | `String, String -> Result<String, String>` | HTTP POST request (body as JSON; sends `Content-Type: application/json`) |

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Http effect declarations list" -->
```vera
effects(<Http>)                  -- network access
effects(<Http, IO>)              -- network + IO
```

Both operations return `Result<String, String>` — `Ok` with the response body on success, `Err` with the error message on failure. Compose with `json_parse` for typed API responses:

```vera
public fn fetch_json(@String -> @Result<Json, String>)
  requires(string_length(@String.0) > 0)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<Http>)
{
  let @Result<String, String> = Http.get(@String.0);
  match @Result<String, String>.0 {
    Ok(@String) -> json_parse(@String.0),
    Err(@String) -> Err(@String.0)
  }
}
```

Like IO, `Http` is a built-in effect. Unlike IO, it has a fixed set of two operations — there is no need to restrict operations via an explicit declaration.

### Inference effect

The `Inference` effect makes LLM calls explicit in the type system. It is built-in — no `effect Inference { ... }` declaration is needed.

| Operation | Signature | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `Inference.complete` | `String -> Result<String, String>` | Send a prompt, return `Ok(completion)` or `Err(message)` |

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Inference effect declarations list" -->
```vera
effects(<Inference>)             -- LLM access
effects(<Inference, IO>)         -- LLM + console output
effects(<Http, Inference>)       -- fetch + LLM
```

Returns `Result<String, String>` — `Ok` with the completion text on success, `Err` with the error message on failure. Provider is selected from environment variables: `VERA_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VERA_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `VERA_MOONSHOT_API_KEY` (Kimi), `VERA_MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `VERA_XAI_API_KEY` (Grok), or `VERA_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. Auto-detection walks the provider registry in insertion order — `anthropic`, `openai`, `moonshot`, `mistral`, `xai`, `deepseek` — and takes the first whose key is set to a non-empty value — an empty string is skipped, as if unset — so when several are set the earliest in that order wins. Setting `VERA_INFERENCE_PROVIDER` (valid values: `anthropic`, `openai`, `moonshot`, `mistral`, `xai`, `deepseek`) skips detection entirely and forces that provider; `VERA_INFERENCE_MODEL` overrides its default model.  See [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](ENVIRONMENT.md) for the full env-var reference.

```vera
private fn classify(@String -> @Result<String, String>)
  requires(string_length(@String.0) > 0)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<Inference>)
{
  let @String = string_concat("Classify the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral: ", @String.0);
  Inference.complete(@String.0)
}
```

Compose with `match` to handle the `Result`:

```vera
public fn safe_classify(@String -> @String)
  requires(string_length(@String.0) > 0)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<Inference>)
{
  let @Result<String, String> = classify(@String.0);
  match @Result<String, String>.0 {
    Ok(@String) -> @String.0,
    Err(@String) -> "unknown"
  }
}
```

Like `Http`, `Inference` is host-backed. The browser runtime returns a detailed `Err` explaining that API keys cannot be safely embedded in client-side JavaScript; use a server-side proxy with `Http` instead.

### Random effect

The `Random` effect provides non-deterministic number generation. Like `IO` and `Http`, it is built-in — no `effect Random { ... }` declaration is needed. Functions that draw random values must declare `effects(<Random>)`, making the non-determinism visible in the type signature.

| Operation | Signature | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `Random.random_int` | `Int, Int -> Int` | Random integer in inclusive range `[low, high]` (caller ensures `low <= high`) |
| `Random.random_float` | `Unit -> Float64` | Uniform random in `[0.0, 1.0)` |
| `Random.random_bool` | `Unit -> Bool` | Coin flip |

```vera
private fn pick_card(@Unit -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Int.result >= 1 && @Int.result <= 52)
  effects(<Random>)
{
  Random.random_int(1, 52)
}
```

The Python runtime backs Random onto the `random` module (`random.randint`, `random.random()`). The browser runtime backs all three onto `Math.random()` — fast, non-cryptographic, adequate for games and simulations. There is no seeding API yet (deterministic testing via `handle[Random]` is future work).

Functions that mix randomness with other effects compose normally:

```vera
public fn print_random_card(-> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO, Random>)
{
  IO.print(int_to_string(pick_card(())))
}
```

### DB effect

The `DB` effect executes SQL against a relational database. Like `IO` and `Http`, it is built-in — no `effect DB { ... }` declaration is needed. Functions that read or write the database must declare `effects(<DB>)`.

| Operation | Signature | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `DB.execute` | `String, Array<Option<String>> -> Result<Int, String>` | Runs a write (`CREATE`/`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`); `Ok` carries the affected-row count |
| `DB.query` | `String, Array<Option<String>> -> Result<Array<Array<Option<String>>>, String>` | Runs a `SELECT`; `Ok` is a grid of rows, each cell an `Option<String>` (SQL `NULL` is `None`) |

The second argument is the positional parameter list bound to the `?` placeholders: `Some(v)` binds a value, `None` binds SQL `NULL`. Bind data as parameters rather than splicing it into the SQL text — a bound value can never be parsed as SQL, the standard defence against injection.

```vera
public fn insert_and_count(-> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<DB>)
{
  match DB.execute("CREATE TABLE users (name TEXT, nickname TEXT)", []) {
    Err(@String) -> -1,
    Ok(@Int) -> match DB.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, nickname) VALUES (?, ?)", [Some("Ada"), None]) {
      Err(@String) -> -1,
      Ok(@Int) -> match DB.query("SELECT name, nickname FROM users", []) {
        Err(@String) -> -1,
        Ok(@Array<Array<Option<String>>>) -> array_length(@Array<Array<Option<String>>>.0)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A query result is `Array<Array<Option<String>>>` — rows of cells, each cell `Some(text)` or `None` for SQL `NULL`. `NULL` and `""` stay distinct; read a `NOT NULL` column with `option_unwrap_or(cell, "")`. Both operations return `Result`, so a failed statement is the `Err(String)` arm, never a trap.

**Keep the SQL literal.** The query string must be a literal (or a `string_concat` / `let` chain of literals). A SQL string built from a runtime value — a call result, a parameter, or a `\(expr)` interpolation of one — is a **compile-time error** (`E207`): that is the injection vector. (An interpolation or concatenation whose parts are all literals stays literal, so it is accepted.) Pass every runtime value through a `?` placeholder and the params array — `DB.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [Some(@String.0)])`, never `DB.query(string_concat("... id = ", @String.0), [])`. A `?`-placeholder/parameter count mismatch is `E208` when both are statically known.

The connection is chosen by `VERA_DB_URL` (default `sqlite::memory:`, or `sqlite:///path/to/file.db`). In v1 the effect is SQLite-only, single-connection, and un-mockable (`handle[DB]` awaits #372). The browser runtime returns `Err` for every `DB` operation, and `vera compile --target wasi-p2` rejects `<DB>`.

### Effect handlers

Handlers eliminate an effect, converting effectful code to pure code:

```vera
private fn run_counter(@Unit -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  handle[State<Int>](@Int = 0) {
    get(@Unit) -> { resume(@Int.0) },
    put(@Int) -> { resume(()) }
  } in {
    put(42);
    get(())
  }
}
```

Handler syntax:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Handler with-clause pseudocode, bare expression" -->
```vera
handle[EffectName<TypeArgs>](@StateType = initial_value) {
  operation(@ParamType) -> { handler_body },
  operation(@ParamType) -> { handler_body } with @StateType = new_value,
  ...
} in {
  handled_body
}
```

Use `resume(value)` in a handler clause to continue the handled computation with the given return value.

For `State<T>`, `put(x)` stores `x` as the new state **intrinsically** — the canonical clause `put(@T) -> { resume(()) }` needs no `with` (see `run_counter` above). A `with @T = expr` clause **overrides** that intrinsic store, letting a clause *transform* what gets written. Inside a `put` clause the state slot `@T.0` is the state **before** the store and `@T.1` is the argument being stored (operation parameters bind first, state last — most-recent wins):

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Handler with-clause, bare put arm expression" -->
```vera
put(@Int) -> { resume(()) } with @Int = @Int.1 * 2   -- store double the argument
```

Because `@T.0` is the pre-store state, `with @T = @T.0` keeps the *old* state — it silently undoes the `put`. For an ordinary "store the argument" `put`, omit `with` entirely; reach for it only to transform the stored value. The `with` expression's type must match the handler's state type.

For the builtin `State` effect the state declaration **is** the `State<T>` cell: its declared type must structurally equal the effect's `T` after alias resolution (for refined types, predicate included), or the handle is a checker error (E336) — declare `handle[State<Nat>](@Nat = ...)`, never `(@Int = ...)`. An alias that resolves to `T`, like `type Count = Nat` with `(@Count = ...)`, is fine, and scalar aliases work as the cell type: `handle[State<Count>]`. A refined cell must use a **named** refinement alias on both sides — `type Small = { @Nat | @Nat.0 < 10 }; handle[State<Small>](@Small = 0)` — never an inline refinement literal in the `State<T>` argument (not compilable) or a refinement on the declaration alone (E336: nothing would enforce it). A handler **without** a state declaration binds no state slot in its clauses — in a stateless `put` clause, `@T.0` is the operation's argument. A user-declared effect's handler state is the handler's own accumulator and may take any type.

### Qualified operation calls

When two effects have operations with the same name, qualify the call:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Qualified effect calls (State.put, Logger.put)" -->
```vera
State.put(42);
Logger.put("message");
```

### State handler with a loop helper

The most common State pattern uses a `where` block to define a loop helper with `effects(<State<Int>>)`. The handler wraps the entire computation; the helper calls `get` and `put` directly.

```vera
-- Sum 1..n using State<Int>
private fn add_value(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Int.result == @Int.1 + @Int.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.1 + @Int.0
}

public fn sum_with_state(@Nat -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  handle[State<Int>](@Int = 0) {
    get(@Unit) -> { resume(@Int.0) },
    put(@Int) -> { resume(()) }
  } in {
    sum_loop(@Nat.0, 1)
  }
}
where {
  fn sum_loop(@Nat, @Nat -> @Int)
    requires(true)
    ensures(true)
    decreases(@Nat.1 - @Nat.0 + 1)
    effects(<State<Int>>)
  {
    if @Nat.0 > @Nat.1 then {
      get(())
    } else {
      put(add_value(get(()), @Nat.0));
      sum_loop(@Nat.1, @Nat.0 + 1)
    }
  }
}
```

Key points:
- The outer function `sum_with_state` is **pure** — the handler discharges the State effect
- The `where` block helper `sum_loop` has `effects(<State<Int>>)` — it uses `get`/`put` directly
- Functions inside `where` blocks do NOT take `public`/`private` visibility
- The `put` clause stores its argument as the new state intrinsically — no `with` clause is needed for the common "store the value" case (a `with` clause is only for *transforming* the stored value; see the handler-syntax notes above)
- Pure helper functions (like `add_value`) can be called from the `where` block helper (`sum_loop`)
- The `decreases` clause on the loop helper ensures termination

## Where Blocks (Mutual Recursion)

```vera
private fn is_even(@Nat -> @Bool)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  decreases(@Nat.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Nat.0 == 0 then {
    true
  } else {
    is_odd(@Nat.0 - 1)
  }
}
where {
  fn is_odd(@Nat -> @Bool)
    requires(true)
    ensures(true)
    decreases(@Nat.0)
    effects(pure)
  {
    if @Nat.0 == 0 then {
      false
    } else {
      is_even(@Nat.0 - 1)
    }
  }
}
```

## Generic Functions

```vera
private forall<T> fn identity(@T -> @T)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @T.0
}
```

## Abilities (Type Constraints)

Abilities constrain type variables in generic functions. An ability declares operations that a type must support:

```vera
ability Eq<T> {
  op eq(T, T -> Bool);
}
```

Use `where` in the `forall` clause to constrain type parameters:

```vera
private forall<T where Eq<T>> fn are_equal(@T, @T -> @Bool)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  eq(@T.1, @T.0)
}
```

Four built-in abilities are available — no declarations needed:

- **`Eq<T>`** — `eq(x, y)` returns `@Bool`. Satisfied by: Int, Nat, Bool, Float64, String, Byte, Unit, and ADTs (including `Option` / `Result`, recursive, nested-generic, and mutually-recursive) whose fields are themselves `Eq` (structural derivation). Unlike `Hash`/`Show`, `Tuple`, `Array`, `Map`, and `Set` are **not** Eq-derivable — a non-Eq `==` / `eq` is rejected at check with E243.
- **`Ord<T>`** — `compare(x, y)` returns `@Ordering` (`Less`, `Equal`, `Greater`). Satisfied by: Int, Nat, Float64, Byte, String — exactly the orderable types (the `<`/`>`/`<=`/`>=` domain). A user ADT is **not** Ord-derivable, and neither is `Bool`; `compare` on a non-orderable operand is rejected with E242 (mirroring E143 on a direct `<`).
- **`Hash<T>`** — `hash(x)` returns `@Int`. Satisfied by: Int, Nat, Bool, Float64, String, Byte, Unit, and composite types (ADT, Tuple, Option, Result, Array) whose fields/elements are themselves `Hash` (structural derivation).
- **`Show<T>`** — `show(x)` returns `@String`. Satisfied by: Int, Nat, Bool, Float64, String, Byte, Unit, and composite types (ADT, Tuple, Option, Result, Array) whose fields/elements are themselves `Show`; renders `Ctor(f0, f1, …)` / `(a, b)` / `Some(x)` / `Ok(x)` / `[e0, e1, …]`.

The `Ordering` type is a built-in ADT with three constructors: `Less`, `Equal`, `Greater`. Use it with pattern matching:

```vera
public fn signum(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  match compare(@Int.1, @Int.0) {
    Less -> 0 - 1,
    Equal -> 0,
    Greater -> 1
  }
}
```

Key rules:
- Abilities are first-order only: `Eq<T>`, not `Mappable<F>` where `F` is a type constructor
- Constraint syntax: `forall<T where Eq<T>>` — constraints go inside the angle brackets
- Multiple constraints: `forall<T where Eq<T>, Ord<T>>`
- Ability declarations mirror effect declarations (both use `op`)
- User-defined abilities are supported with the same syntax
- ADT auto-derivation: `Eq` is derived **structurally** — a simple enum, or an ADT every field of which is itself `Eq` (an `Eq` primitive including `String` (compared by content), or a nested `Eq` ADT, recursively). A field with no `Eq` semantics (`Array`, `Map`, a host handle) makes the ADT non-derivable.
- Unsatisfied constraints produce error E613

## Modules

```vera
module vera.math;

import vera.collections;
import vera.collections(List, Option);

public fn exported(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0
}
```

Every top-level `fn` and `data` must have explicit `public` or `private` visibility. Use `public` for functions that other modules should be able to import.

Import paths resolve to files on disk: `import vera.math;` looks for `vera/math.vera` relative to the importing file's directory (or the project root). Imported files are parsed and cached automatically. Circular imports are detected and reported as errors.

Imported functions can be called by name (bare calls): `import vera.math(magnitude); magnitude(-5)` resolves `magnitude` from the imported module. Selective imports restrict available names; wildcard imports (`import m;`) make all declarations available. Local definitions shadow imported names. Imported ADT constructors are also available: `import col(List); Cons(1, Nil)`.

Imported function contracts are verified at call sites by the SMT solver. Preconditions of imported functions are checked at each call site; postconditions are assumed. This means `magnitude(x)` with `ensures(@Int.result >= 0)` lets the caller rely on the result being non-negative.

Cross-module compilation uses a flattening strategy: imported function bodies are compiled into the same WASM module as the importing program. The result is a single self-contained `.wasm` binary. Imported functions are internal (not exported); only the importing program's `public` functions are WASM exports.

If two of a namespace's imports supply the same bare name, `vera check` refuses it — E155 (function), E156 (data type), E157 (constructor) — reported at the second supplying import, in whichever file holds the clash. For a **function** name, resolve it either by narrowing one import (`import m(other_name);`) so a single supplier remains, or by declaring the name locally and reaching the imports with the module-qualified form (`m::name(...)`). For a **data type** or **constructor** name, rename the declaration in one of the two modules: compilation refuses two modules' same-named data declarations however the importer filters or shadows them, so no import-side change resolves those. The compile-time rails E608/E609/E610 remain as the backstop and refuse a wider set, reading declarations rather than any namespace's imports: E608 fires when two modules declare the same **function** name at any visibility — the ones that would share the flattened `$name` — unless both are top-level generics whose clones provably live in different module-qualified namespaces; E609 and E610 have no such exception, so any two modules' same-named `data` declarations or constructors collide however they are declared or imported. A local definition shadows an imported **function** name without error — that is checker resolution, and the bare call becomes the local one. It does not extend to data: E609/E610 reject two modules' same-named data types or constructors at compile whatever the importer declares or imports, so a local `data` of the same name does not clear them.

A module's data type may also collide with one the prelude provides (`Option`, `Result`, `Ordering`, `UrlParts`, `Json`, `HtmlNode`, `Request`, `Response`). One name carries one layout in the compiled program, so the two contend when their shapes differ — different constructors, a different constructor order, different field types, or a different number of type parameters (their names are free, since they are matched by position). The compiler then reports **E621** at the module's declaration; rename it there, or give it the prelude's shape. A module declaring `data Json` is legal on its own, because the prelude injects `Json` only when the entry program uses it; `Option`, `Result`, `Ordering` and `UrlParts` are in every program, so a differently-shaped module declaration of one of those always contends. Declaring the type in the **entry** file instead suppresses the prelude's own, so it never contends with the prelude — but it does not settle a clash with a module that also declares the name, which is a separate pair the compiler does not yet arbitrate ([#1312](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/1312)).

Type aliases and effect declarations are module-local and cannot be imported. If another module needs the same alias or effect, it must declare its own copy.

Module-qualified calls use `::` between the module path and the function name: `vera.math::magnitude(42)`. The dot-separated path identifies the module and `::` separates it from the function name. This syntax can be used anywhere a function call is valid, and always resolves against the specific module's public declarations — it is not affected by local shadowing. Note: qualification names a call site, not an import list, so writing a clashing call as `m::name(42)` does not by itself lift E155 — the ambiguity is in the namespace. It is how you reach both suppliers once a local declaration or a narrowed import has settled which one owns the bare name.

There is no import aliasing (`import m(abs as math_abs)`) and no wildcard exclusion (`import m hiding(x)`). These are intentional design decisions, not limitations. When a function name clashes across two imports, narrow one import or declare the name locally and qualify the rest; when a data type or constructor name clashes, rename it in one of the source modules. This preserves the one-canonical-form principle — every declaration has exactly one name.

There are no raw strings (`r"..."`) or multi-line string literals. Use escape sequences for special characters; this is by design — alternative string syntaxes would create two representations for the same value.

The full set of escape sequences Vera's lexer accepts:

| Escape | Produces | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `\n` | LF (0x0A) | |
| `\t` | TAB (0x09) | |
| `\r` | CR (0x0D) | |
| `\0` | NUL (0x00) | |
| `\\` | backslash | |
| `\"` | double-quote | |
| `\u{XXXX}` | Unicode code point | 1–6 hex digits, up to U+10FFFF |

`\v` / `\f` / `\x..` / `\a` / `\b` are **not** recognised — Vera's rule is "one canonical form per value". For ASCII control bytes outside the simple-escape set (e.g. ESC 0x1B, VT 0x0B, FF 0x0C), either use the unicode escape (`"\u{1B}"`, `"\u{0B}"`, `"\u{0C}"`) or call `string_from_char_code(N)` at runtime:

<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="ANSI cursor-home via string_from_char_code (#513)" -->
```vera
-- ANSI cursor-home sequence (ESC [ H):
let @String = string_concat(string_from_char_code(27), "[H");
-- or equivalently using the unicode escape:
let @String = "\u{1B}[H";
```

Raw UTF-8 bytes in string literals are supported — the lexer reads the source as UTF-8 and stores the bytes unchanged. `"██ hello ██"` compiles and prints the six UTF-8 bytes of each block character. `string_length`, indexing, and the classifiers operate on bytes, not grapheme clusters; see the #509 roadmap entry for tracked Unicode-aware variants.

See: spec Chapter 8 for the full module system specification.

{- block comment -}

{- block comments {- can nest -} -}
```

## Operators (by precedence, loosest to tightest)

| Precedence | Operators | Associativity |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | `\|>` (pipe) | left |
| 2 | `==>` (implies, contracts only) | right |
| 3 | `\|\|` | left |
| 4 | `&&` | left |
| 5 | `==` `!=` | none |
| 6 | `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | none |
| 7 | `+` `-` | left |
| 8 | `*` `/` `%` | left |
| 9 | `!` `-` (unary) | prefix |
| 10 | `[]` (index) `()` (call) | postfix |

## Best Practices

### Keep functions small

Vera's De Bruijn slot references (`@T.n`) are clear when functions have 2–3 parameters of different types. They become harder to track with 4+ parameters of the same type or long let-chains where indices shift with each binding.

**Guidelines:**
- Keep functions under ~5 parameters total
- When multiple parameters share a type, prefer breaking into smaller helper functions or where-functions
- Break long let-chains (4+ bindings of the same type) into where-functions — they create fresh scopes with reset slot indices
- Commutative operations (`+`, `*`) mask index errors; be especially careful with non-commutative operations (`-`, `/`, `<`, `>`) and recursive calls

### Use typed holes to build incrementally

When writing a new function, start with `?` placeholders and check the skeleton first. The `W001` warning tells you the expected type and lists every available binding — it is the cheapest way to confirm the return type is correct before writing the body:

```vera
public fn gcd(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(@Int.1 > 0 && @Int.0 > 0)
  ensures(@Int.result > 0)
  effects(pure)
{
  ?   -- W001: expected Int. Available bindings: @Int.0: Int; @Int.1: Int
}
```

Read the hint, then fill in the expression. This is especially useful when De Bruijn indices are non-obvious — the hint always shows the correct `@T.n` form for every binding in scope.

### Use where-functions for complex logic

Where-functions are private helpers scoped to their parent function. They reset the slot index namespace, making code easier to reason about:

```vera
public fn process(@Int, @Int, @String -> @Int)
  requires(@Int.1 > 0)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  compute(@Int.1, @Int.0, string_length(@String.0))
}
where {
  fn compute(@Int, @Int, @Int -> @Int)
    requires(true)
    ensures(true)
    effects(pure)
  {
    (@Int.2 + @Int.1) * @Int.0
  }
}
```

## Common Mistakes

### Missing contract block

WRONG:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: missing contracts" -->
```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int) {
  @Int.0 + @Int.1
}
```

CORRECT:
```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Int.result == @Int.0 + @Int.1)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 + @Int.1
}
```

### Missing effects clause

WRONG:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: missing effects clause (with contracts)" -->
```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
{
  @Int.0 + @Int.1
}
```

CORRECT — add `effects(pure)` (or the appropriate effect row):
```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 + @Int.1
}
```

### Wrong slot index

WRONG — both `@Int.0` refer to the same binding (the second parameter):
```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 + @Int.0
}
```

CORRECT — `@Int.1` is the first parameter, `@Int.0` is the second:
```vera
private fn add(@Int, @Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0 + @Int.1
}
```

### Missing index on slot reference

WRONG:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: bare @Int + @Int without indices" -->
```vera
@Int + @Int
```

CORRECT:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Correct: indexed slot arithmetic" -->
```vera
@Int.0 + @Int.1
```

### Missing decreases on recursive function

WRONG:
```vera
private fn factorial(@Nat -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Nat.0 == 0 then {
    1
  } else {
    @Nat.0 * factorial(@Nat.0 - 1)
  }
}
```

CORRECT:
```vera
private fn factorial(@Nat -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  decreases(@Nat.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Nat.0 == 0 then {
    1
  } else {
    @Nat.0 * factorial(@Nat.0 - 1)
  }
}
```

### Undeclared effects

WRONG — `IO.print` performs IO but function declares `pure`:
```vera
private fn greet(@String -> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  IO.print(@String.0);
  ()
}
```

CORRECT:
```vera
private fn greet(@String -> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO>)
{
  IO.print(@String.0);
  ()
}
```

### Using `@T.result` outside ensures

WRONG:
```vera
private fn f(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(@Int.result > 0)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0
}
```

CORRECT — `@T.result` is only valid in `ensures`:
```vera
private fn f(@Int -> @Int)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Int.result > 0)
  effects(pure)
{
  @Int.0
}
```

### Non-exhaustive match

WRONG:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: non-exhaustive match (missing arm)" -->
```vera
match @Option<Int>.0 {
  Some(@Int) -> @Int.0
}
```

CORRECT:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Correct: match with Option arms (bare)" -->
```vera
match @Option<Int>.0 {
  Some(@Int) -> @Int.0,
  None -> 0
}
```

### Missing braces on if/else branches

WRONG:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: missing braces on if/else branches" -->
```vera
if @Bool.0 then 1 else 0
```

CORRECT:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Correct: if/else with braces (common mistakes)" -->
```vera
if @Bool.0 then {
  1
} else {
  0
}
```

### Trying to use import aliasing

WRONG — Vera does not support renaming imports:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: import aliasing not supported" -->
```vera
import vera.math(magnitude as math_magnitude);
```

CORRECT — use selective import and qualified calls for readability:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Correct: import syntax example" -->
```vera
import vera.math(magnitude);
vera.math::magnitude(-5)
```

Note: if two of a namespace's imports supply the same bare name, `vera check` refuses it (E155 function / E156 data type / E157 constructor). Narrow one import or declare a function name locally; rename a clashing data type or constructor in one of the source modules.

### Trying to use wildcard exclusion

WRONG — Vera does not support `hiding` syntax:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: import hiding not supported" -->
```vera
import vera.math hiding(larger);
```

CORRECT — use selective import to list the names you need:
```vera
import vera.math(magnitude, larger);
```

### Trying to use raw or multi-line strings

WRONG — Vera does not support raw strings or multi-line literals:
```
r"path\to\file"
"""multi-line
string"""
```

CORRECT — use escape sequences:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Correct escape sequence examples, bare strings" -->
```vera
"path\\to\\file"
"line one\nline two"
```

### Standalone `map_new()` / `set_new()` without type context

WRONG — type inference cannot resolve the key/value or element types:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Wrong: standalone map_new/set_new without type context" -->
```vera
let @Map = map_new();
let @Set = set_new();
```

CORRECT — nest inside an operation so types can be inferred, or provide explicit type annotation:
<!-- vera:skip-parse category="FRAGMENT" reason="Correct: map_new/set_new with type context" -->
```vera
let @Map<String, Int> = map_new();
map_insert(map_new(), "key", 42)
let @Set<Int> = set_new();
set_add(set_new(), 1)
```

## Complete Program Examples

### Pure function with postconditions

```vera
public fn absolute_value(@Int -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Nat.result >= 0)
  ensures(@Nat.result == @Int.0 || @Nat.result == -@Int.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Int.0 >= 0 then {
    @Int.0
  } else {
    -@Int.0
  }
}
```

### Recursive function with termination proof

```vera
public fn factorial(@Nat -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Nat.result >= 1)
  decreases(@Nat.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Nat.0 == 0 then {
    1
  } else {
    @Nat.0 * factorial(@Nat.0 - 1)
  }
}
```

### Stateful effects with old/new

```vera
public fn increment(@Unit -> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(new(State<Int>) == old(State<Int>) + 1)
  effects(<State<Int>>)
{
  let @Int = get(());
  put(@Int.0 + 1);
  ()
}
```

### ADT with pattern matching

```vera
private data List<T> {
  Nil,
  Cons(T, List<T>)
}

public fn length(@List<Int> -> @Nat)
  requires(true)
  ensures(@Nat.result >= 0)
  decreases(@List<Int>.0)
  effects(pure)
{
  match @List<Int>.0 {
    Nil -> 0,
    Cons(@Int, @List<Int>) -> 1 + length(@List<Int>.0)
  }
}
```

### Iteration with IO

FizzBuzz with a recursive loop and IO effects. `fizzbuzz` is pure; `loop` and `main` have `effects(<IO>)`. Run with `vera run examples/fizzbuzz.vera`.

```vera
public fn fizzbuzz(@Nat -> @String)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(pure)
{
  if @Nat.0 % 15 == 0 then {
    "FizzBuzz"
  } else {
    if @Nat.0 % 3 == 0 then {
      "Fizz"
    } else {
      if @Nat.0 % 5 == 0 then {
        "Buzz"
      } else {
        "\(@Nat.0)"
      }
    }
  }
}

private fn loop(@Nat, @Nat -> @Unit)
  requires(@Nat.0 <= @Nat.1)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO>)
{
  IO.print(string_concat(fizzbuzz(@Nat.0), "\n"));
  if @Nat.0 < @Nat.1 then {
    loop(@Nat.1, @Nat.0 + 1)
  } else {
    ()
  }
}

public fn main(@Unit -> @Unit)
  requires(true)
  ensures(true)
  effects(<IO>)
{
  loop(100, 1)
}
```

## Conformance Suite

The `tests/conformance/` directory contains 244 small programs — most self-contained, with the Chapter 8 module-system programs and a few cross-module Chapter 7 and 9 programs importing companion `_lib.vera` / `_mid.vera` modules — that validate every language feature against the spec — often one program per feature, though some features (slot references, match, contracts) span several. These are the best minimal working examples of Vera syntax and semantics.

Each program is organized by spec chapter (`ch01_int_literals.vera`, `ch04_match_basic.vera`, `ch07_state_handler.vera`, etc.) and the `manifest.json` file maps features to programs. When you need to see how a specific construct works, check the conformance program before reading the spec.

Key conformance programs by feature:

| Feature | Program |
|---------|---------|
| Slot references (`@T.n`) | `ch03_slot_basic.vera`, `ch03_slot_indexing.vera` |
| Typed holes (`?`) | `ch03_typed_holes.vera` |
| Match expressions | `ch04_match_basic.vera`, `ch04_match_nested.vera` |
| Contracts (requires/ensures) | `ch06_requires.vera`, `ch06_ensures.vera` |
| Effect handlers | `ch07_state_handler.vera`, `ch07_exn_handler.vera` |
| Closures | `ch05_closures.vera` |
| Generics | `ch02_generics.vera` |
| Recursive ADTs | `ch02_adt_recursive.vera` |

## Known Limitations

These are known limitations in the current reference implementation. Most are tracked as open issues; those without an issue link are noted as such.

| Limitation | Details | Issue |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Effect row variable unification | Effect rows containing type variables (e.g. `<E>` in a generic function) are not unified with concrete effect rows at call sites. Functions that abstract over effects require explicit row declarations. | [#294](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/294) |
| `map_new()` / `set_new()` require type context | The empty-collection constructors `map_new()` and `set_new()` cannot infer their key/value types without a surrounding type annotation. Assign the result to a typed `let` binding: `let @Map<String, Int> = map_new();` | — |
| `Inference.complete` has no `max_tokens` or temperature controls | The host implementation uses provider defaults. Custom parameters (max tokens, temperature, top-p, system prompt) are not yet supported at the Vera level. | [#370](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/370) |
| `Inference` effect has no user-defined handlers | In the current implementation, `Inference` is always host-backed (dispatches to a real API). User-defined handlers for mocking, local models, or replay are not yet supported. | [#372](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/372) |
| `DB` effect has no user-defined handlers | `DB` is always host-backed; `handle[DB]` for mocking or replay is not yet supported (shared with the other host effects). Test against `sqlite::memory:` for a hermetic real database. | [#372](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/372) |
| `DB` effect is SQLite-only with positional string rows | Phase 1 supports SQLite only, a single connection per run, and stringly-typed positional rows (`Array<Array<Option<String>>>`). Named columns, typed cells, other backends, and transactions are future work. | [#1143](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/1143) |
| Nested handlers over the SAME cell type, with an operation in a clause body | A bare `get`/`put` in a clause body is the ENCLOSING context's operation (spec §7.5.2), but the host state intrinsics address only the innermost cell of a family — so when the enclosing handler (or the function's declared row) is the *same* `State<T>`, the outer cell cannot be reached. That shape is a loud `E602` codegen skip rather than a silently wrong write. Nest handlers over *different* cell types, or refine the inner cell with `with @T = expr`, which is the clause's own state override. Handler nesting is also capped at 8 levels of outward clause re-entry (the expansion is exponential in the nesting depth); past it the function is a loud `E602`. | [#1233](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/1233) |
| Browser target: `IO.sleep` freezes the tab | `IO.sleep` busy-waits the browser's main thread, so animations and paced simulations don't run meaningfully under `--target browser`. Until the JSPI-based suspend/resume fix lands, write browser-target programs as a pure simulation core with a JS driver, or stick to terminal output. | [#609](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/609) |
| Browser target: ANSI escapes render as literal text | ANSI escape sequences (cursor control, screen clear) appear as literal control characters in the DOM rather than being interpreted. Terminal-style rendering needs the planned ANSI-subset interpreter in `runtime.mjs`; no language change is required. | [#610](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/610) |

## Known Bugs and Workarounds

Current reference-implementation bugs that an agent writing Vera code is likely to hit. Most entries have a confirmed reproducer and a known workaround; an observed one-off CI flake is tracked with reporting guidance instead. The full curated list is in [KNOWN_ISSUES.md](https://github.com/aallan/vera/blob/main/KNOWN_ISSUES.md); the issue tracker is the source of truth.

| Shape | Bug summary | Workaround | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Interpolating a refinement-typed value | `"n=\(@PosInt.0)"` under `type PosInt = { @Int \| @Int.0 > 0 };` is rejected with `E148`, although the identical interpolation through a plain alias (`type Plain = Int;`) checks clean — the conversion test reads the written type rather than the resolved one. | Convert explicitly and concatenate: `string_concat("n=", int_to_string(@PosInt.0))` checks clean. Use `float_to_string` for a `Float64` refinement. | [#1347](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/1347) |
| Rare conformance-gate flake | `ch05_closure_nat_return` trapped once in a full conformance run and never again (~960 clean attempts) — suspected runtime/GC timing interaction, not a compiler defect. | If CI reds on this program with `Reached unreachable` in `main`, re-run and report on the issue with wasmtime version + load conditions — do not chase the compiler. | [#996](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/996) |

When a Vera program type-checks cleanly, compiles without errors, and then produces a runtime trap you can't explain, runtime trap diagnostics are now Vera-native end-to-end: each trap carries a `kind` label (`divide_by_zero` / `out_of_bounds` / `stack_exhausted` / `unreachable` / `overflow` / `contract_violation` / `host_error` / `unknown`), a per-kind `Fix:` paragraph naming the canonical remediation (omitted for `contract_violation` and `host_error`, whose descriptions already carry the specific instruction, and for `unknown`, where there is nothing general to suggest), and a source backtrace pointing at the offending Vera function and line — not just `wasm trap: <reason>`.  Tail-recursive iteration runs in constant WASM stack space for both non-allocating ([#517](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/517), v0.0.126) and allocating ([#549](https://github.com/aallan/vera/issues/549), v0.0.154) tail calls — the latter prepends a `$gc_sp` restore before each `return_call` to keep the shadow stack bounded across iterations.
