# Organized authorization assessment instruction (B)

Analyze each runnable obligation in the canonical declaration. Follow the declared required analysis, constraints, policy authority, and scope assurance. Explain the source-visible decision without assuming repository discovery or deployment facts. Address every supplied analysis question and report its coverage without inventing an answer.

## Canonical declaration
This is task gitea-collaborator-permission, expressed with source-authorization-assessment/v0. May an authenticated repository-read collaborator who is neither a site administrator nor a repository administrator query another existing user's repository permission?
Assess repository https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea at source ref fc28937a8d772fe9e4025c9b5f24d5db4d86610b in fixed-context mode. Source discovery status is not-tested.

The accepted policy material is:
- policy:collaborator-permission is a explicit-task-requirement at source/policy.json#/normativePolicy, revision fc28937a8d772fe9e4025c9b5f24d5db4d86610b.
  Policy text: A caller may query a collaborator's repository permission when the caller is a site administrator, is a repository administrator, or is querying their own username. If none of those relations holds, the request is rejected with HTTP 403 before the target collaborator is loaded.
  Acceptance is accepted; accepting actor role: task-author; reason: The supplied policy metadata states the accepted bounded rule for the fixed source entry.

The principals are:
- principal:caller has role authenticated repository-read collaborator. Author facts: ["Authenticated","Has repository read access","Is a collaborator","Is not a site administrator","Is not a repository administrator","Queries another existing user's username"]
  Starting capabilities: authenticated, repository-read, collaborator.

The resources are:
- resource:collaborator-permission is a repository collaborator permission. Author facts: ["Existing collaborator account different from the caller","Repository permission queried through the collaborator permission endpoint"]

The declared source entries are:
- entry:get-repo-permissions names GetRepoPermissions.
  Source location: collaborators.go, startLine 1, endLine 58.

The authorization obligations are:
- scenario:different-user-query: principal principal:caller, resource resource:collaborator-permission, relation caller-username-differs-from-collaborator-username, operation GET collaborator repository permission, expected policy disposition deny.
  Policy source: policy:collaborator-permission. Declared entries: entry:get-repo-permissions.
  Conditions: none declared.

Scope assurance: Only explicitly declared scenarios and supplied source are assessed; repository discovery and deployment behavior are not tested.
Required analysis:
- Trace entry, identity and resource binding, strongest authorization control, and protected effect. Explain decisive missing source-external facts.
Constraints:
- Use only supplied fixed source context. Do not execute or modify the target, contact a deployment, or claim repository-wide discovery.
Allowed conclusions: source_supported_failure, source_refuted, unknown.

## Public analysis questions
- Which source-visible condition or control gates the declared entry before the assessed path proceeds?
- How is the declared principal bound to the runtime caller or identity used by the assessed operation?
- How is the request-selected object bound to the declared resource, and which other checked resource must remain distinct?
- What is the strongest source-visible authorization decision for this principal, resource relation, operation, and condition set, including any role or ownership branch?
- After the visible controls, can the requested operation reach the declared protected effect, and under which source-visible branch?
- Which source-external fact, if any, can change the answer, and is that fact supplied or still unknown in this fixed context?

## Result contract
Use compact wire/v4: top-level results only. Each item has obligationId, conclusion, explanation, facts as an array of {id, kind, statement, citations}, decisiveMissingFacts and suggestedObservations. Fact IDs must be unique within each obligation. kind is entry/binding/control/effect/condition. The host fills all version/identity/scope metadata and groups facts; never output those fields. Include item-local coverage only when an analysis ledger is supplied, and item-local condition only when a condition request is supplied. Branches do not repeat obligationId.
Return exactly one result for every runnable expanded obligation, with one of: source_supported_failure, source_refuted, unknown.
Interpret conclusion labels relative to the declared policy expectation, not as direct synonyms for allow or deny:
- source_supported_failure: the fixed source supports that the declared policy expectation fails under the stated conditions.
- source_refuted: the fixed source supports that the declared policy expectation is enforced under the stated conditions, refuting a policy failure.
- unknown: the fixed source and declared context are insufficient to decide whether the expectation fails or is enforced.
Exact runnable obligation IDs (closed list):
- scenario%3Adifferent-user-query::entry%3Aget-repo-permissions
Use each exact expanded ID verbatim as obligationId. Do not substitute the authored obligation ID, omit an ID, or invent an additional ID.
Support the conclusion with separately identified entry, principal/identity binding, resource binding, strongest visible authorization control, protected effect, and condition facts. Every fact must cite one sourceId and a closed startLine/endLine range from the numbered exact source catalog. Do not copy paths or quotations; the host binds both from the selected source range. A range cannot cross sources. For unknown, also name each decisive missing fact and the minimum observation that would decide it. Treat source discovery as not-tested: never turn completed declared obligations or a fixed source crop into a whole-repository or all-entry completeness claim.
Address every public analysis question in the explanation and source-backed facts. No separate coverage ledger is required for this plain-method answer.
